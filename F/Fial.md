Goddess Fial was a deity worshipped by the Celts who represented the River Feale. This river flowed into the Shannon River and was named after the goddess herself. Fial embodied not just the water, but the entire geographical area surrounding the river known as the watershed, and therefore was revered as a goddess of abundance and fertility. In Celtic mythology, Fial was also recognized as the daughter of goddess Macha. According to the legend, the goddess passed away while giving birth to her twin children: a son named Fall and a daughter named Fial, who was also named after the river in which she holds her divine presence.
