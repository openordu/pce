Fasting, known as troscad in Irish and ymprydio in Welsh, was a ritual practiced by the Celts. It was a traditional means of protest in ancient Ireland and Wales to "fast against one's enemy." If someone was wronged, they would sit on the oppressor's doorstep, refusing to eat and informing passersby of their predicament. For those in high positions, like kings and bards, who had caused harm to others, fasting was the sole revenge afforded to the victim instead of being paid the Ã‰ric or honor price. Hunger strikes were recounted in various ancient mythological texts and proved to be a potent form of protest that frequently led to the issue being resolved. Though the tradition waned, it was occasionally revived as a nonviolent protest method.
