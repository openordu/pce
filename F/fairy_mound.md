In the Celtic lands, there are remnants of a civilization that predates the Celts, an unknown people who existed around 5000 B.C.E., the Megalithic Civilization, that constructed numerous stone structures, such as the famous Stonehenge and Brú Na Bóinne, along with less grand structures like the Dolmen, the Passage Grave, and other structures left by a people who spoke an unknown language and worshiped unknown gods, and then vanished for reasons unknown. Even so, their legacy continued as the incoming Celts acknowledged the sanctity of their monuments and solidified it with stories of the fairies who resided within the Barrows and under the Dolmen arches. Sometimes small hills or drumlins were also considered fairy mounds, but typically the ancient barrows were said to cover miniature cities where the fairies cavorted endlessly. It was deemed dangerous to walk past such mounds at night or during Beltane on May 1 and Samhain on November 1, the turning points of the year, because the otherwise invisible door might open and lure in the passerby into the initially pleasurable but ultimately endless and inescapable dance. The Irish term for these fairy mounds is Sídhe and the fairies who populated them are known as Daoine Sídhe, the people of the fairy mounds. Early texts recount that the Daoine Sídhe were once the Tuatha Dé Danann, the ancient magical race sentenced to live underground when the Milesians invaded Ireland.
