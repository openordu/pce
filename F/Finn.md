A famous name among the Irish heroes is Finn. Finn, which means “white” or “fair” and signifies Wisdom rather than physical complexion, was commonly used for both male and female heroes. This name is a variation of the name given to the most renowned Irish hero, Fionn Mac Cumhaill. The most notable Finns, who were referred to as the Three Finns of Emain Macha or Trí Finn Emna, although they were named Bres, Nár, and Lothar, were three identical triplet brothers. They had a sister-lover named Clothra of Connacht whom they impregnated, giving birth to a son who had red stripes on his body that separated the parts inherited from each of his fathers. Moreover, they rebelled against their father, King Eochaid Fedlech of Tara, but were defeated, leading to his death by sorrow.
