Folkloric motif known as the fairy path was prevalent in rural Ireland where building a house in the path fairies took to travel from one region to another was considered ill-advised. Fairies had a peculiar characteristic of following straight paths even if it meant traversing over lakes or bogland or even the sea unlike humans. The rigid routes the fairies followed caused mayhem if a house was built in their way. Anything built on the trajectory of fairies would either be ruined or rendered uninhabitable due to disturbances within the site. The Fairy Blast of wind was a common tactic used by fairies to punish ignorant builders by causing items to move about or taking the culprit away to another space or time. As fairies were believed to reside in the western parts, it was discouraged to build westernly in areas known to be haunted by fairies.
