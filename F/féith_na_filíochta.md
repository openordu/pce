In Irish folklore, there was a belief that Bards possessed the "vein of poetry," which was located in the back of their scalp. When they began composing poetry, they would feel blood rushing through this vein in a particular rhythm, precisely matching the meter required for the poem. The Fenian Cycle, a collection of Irish myths and legends, is still widely popular today. It revolves around legendary heroes like Fionn Mac Cumhaill and his group of warriors, known as the Fianna. Some of the most well-known characters in Irish mythology, such as Oisín the poet, the fated lovers Diarmait and Gráinne, Deirdre of the Sorrows, and the heroic Fionn himself, can be found in these tales. These stories are centered on the southern Irish provinces of Leinster and Munster and, like another great heroic cycle focused on Ulster, often feature mythological deities portrayed in human form. Written versions of the cycle can be found in both ancient and modern texts, while countless oral tales exist that exaggerate the Fianna's warrior exploits.
