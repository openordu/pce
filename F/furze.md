A plant with symbolic significance is the furze. Found widely in the bogs of Ireland, this thorny plant has yellow blooms that give off a scent of vanilla, which lasts a long time throughout the year. It is primarily utilized as tinder, but it has been known to provide fuel for various Need-Fires and other sacred fires due to its abundant nature. According to fairy tales, individuals afflicted by spell or Glamour will misinterpret furze's gold for authentic metal and fill their pockets before discovering a pile of petals upon their return home. (Also refer to Gorse.)
