Folklore in Scotland has it that there was a one-legged, one-eyed monster popularly known as the fachan (athach). This creature was found in the more remote regions of Scotland, terrorizing people who wandered in its habitat. The fachan had one arm growing right from its chest, which it used to hold a flail covered in iron apples. While hopping about on its solitary leg, the fachan would use the flail to attack anyone who passed by. The fachan had two forms- the Athach and the dìreach. The dìreach haunted the desolate Glen Eitive. People believe that the stories surrounding the fachan may have been born out of a fear of a Druid casting spells by standing on one leg with an arm raised, as seen in Glám Dícenn.
