Every substance on earth has its own foyson or toradh, which refers to its essence. The nourishment of food is its foyson, and according to Irish folklore, it is the very thing that the Fairies would steal when they took food. The Milk may still be present in the milk pail, but it would lack its nourishing foyson. Various rituals and verbal Charms were employed to safeguard the foyson of foodstuffs from being stolen Away by fairies.
