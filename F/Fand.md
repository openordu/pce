Fand or Fann is the name of a character from Irish folklore and mythology. She was the most renowned Fairy queen in Ireland and was the beautiful spouse of Manannán Mac Lir, the god of the sea, who, like other Fairy Lovers, stole the heart of a mortal. This mortal was not just any man, but the greatest hero of Ireland, Cúchulainn. In a vision, Fand appeared to him and whipped him until he lost consciousness. He remained in a lovesick state for a year after the encounter. At the end of the year, during the Samhain feast, which is the time when mortals can enter the Otherworld, he went to Fand and left his faithful wife Emer behind. Although Emer had dealt with her husband's infidelity in the past, she could not bear the thought of losing him to FairyLAND and so followed him. After seeing how much Fand loved him, and he her, Emer offered to step down. Fand, not wanting to be outdone, offered the same and returned to her husband, who covered her in a magical cloak to make her forget about the human hero. Cúchulainn and Emer consumed a potion of forgetfulness on earth and returned to their previous state.
