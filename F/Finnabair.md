Finnabair, also known as Findabar or Fionnúir, is a heroine or goddess from Irish mythology. She is the daughter of the beautiful Medb of Connacht and shares many of the same qualities as her goddess-queen mother, including a strong sense of self-worth. Finnabair fell in love with Fráech and agreed to meet him on an island surrounded by a deep pool. Despite having to fight off a fierce sea-monster, Fráech was unable to satisfy the dowry demands of Medb and Ailill mac Máta, Finnabair's parents, due to their desire for Fráech's fortune, which included the Cattle of the Otherworld. The couple faced many obstacles before finally being reunited. However, Finnabair was later captured and taken to a fortress in the Alps, where she was ultimately freed by Fráech. During the Cattle Raid on the northern Province of Ulster, recorded in the epic Tain Bó Cuailnge, Medb offered Finnabair to various warriors in exchange for their help fighting against the hero Cúchulainn, who was single-handedly holding off the Connacht army. Fráech, like many other heroes, took up the challenge, but was ultimately killed. Finnabair died soon after from a broken heart. It is believed that Finnabair is likely a diminished goddess, as are other heroines who share her name, such as Guinevere in the Arthurian cycle, Welsh heroine Gwenhwyfar, and Cornish heroine Jennifer.
