Fairy traditions can be found in various Celtic territories, such as Scotland, the Isle of Man and other parts of Ireland. Nonetheless, there isn’t a single Celtic word that defines the fairies from different areas, prompting speculation about whether there was ever a unified Celtic fairy-faith, or whether the fairies stem from beliefs held by pre-Celtic groups. On the Isle of Man, fairies were referred to as ferrish, which seems to have been adapted from the English word fairy, which has been so ingrained that it can now be seen in place names. Examples include Close ny Ferrishyn, which translates to “fairy hill”. The ferrishyn, who often wore red caps and green coats, resided in nut tree branches and traveled in groups with red-eared white hounds. They had a liking for disorienting individuals who walked the hills in the evening by turning them around so that they lose their way (see Pixy-Led, Stray Sod). Meanwhile, the twlwyth teg or “fair family” referred to fairies in Wales; the spyrys, or “spirits” referred to Cornish fairies, and the Korrigans or “sea-fairies” were recognized as the fairy tradition in Brittany.
