A Scottish folkloric motif is the fairy boat. Sailors whose boats were about to be struck by a storm off the coast of Scotland would sometimes catch sight of a ghostly boat. This premonition allowed them to survive the incoming weather by hauling into shore, provided they heeded the warning. The fairy boat is one of the many traditions where the Fairies and the dead are hopelessly intertwined, as the boat was often said to be crowded with familiar faces, the men from the area who had been lost at sea and were returning to warn their erstwhile friends of danger. In some regions of coastal Ireland, it was believed that people who drowned never really died and had been taken away to dwell with the undersea fairies. Since bodies were frequently missing in the stormy sea, this consoling belief was rarely challenged.
