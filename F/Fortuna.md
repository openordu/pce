Fortuna, a Roman goddess, although not originally Celtic, was still widely worshipped throughout Britain for her ability to guide believers through life's journey, symbolized by her rudder, wheel, and Cornucopia, all representing her power to provide abundance. Celtic goddesses of abundance were typically associated with the earth, whereas Fortuna was revered more in urban areas. However, during her Cerealia festival, which was celebrated in rural Britain until the 19th century, she was also associated with a bountiful harvest.
