The Fairy king Midir had a Druid wife named Fuamnach who became jealous when Midir sought to replace her with the beautiful Étain. To retaliate, Fuamnach used a potion given to her by her foster father to poison Étain, causing the latter to be transformed into an insect. The transformed Étain was referred to as a butterfly in romantic versions of the story and a worm or a fly in others. Some versions of the story state that Fuamnach flicked a branch of a magical tree called Rowan, which turned Étain into a puddle of water, a worm, and a fly. With another flick, Fuamnach created a strong wind that blew the fly out of Midir’s palace. Despite her effort, Fuamnach did not succeed completely as Midir searched and found Étain after her rebirth as a human and brought her back to his Otherworld home. Although Étain was the queen of Tara, she went back to live with Midir.
