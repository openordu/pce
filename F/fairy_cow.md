Fairy cattle, also known as fairy cows or crò sith, were a common theme in folklore. Fairies were known for their generosity towards humans, especially when they offered the use of their cows. The fairy cows were typically hornless and were either red with white ears or speckled red-and-tan. These cows provided large quantities of milk and always gave birth to twin calves. An old story from Co. Donegal told of a family with ten children who were struggling to find food during a lean winter. One night, they heard the sound of lowing and discovered a red-speckled cow outside in the storm. They brought it into the byre and the next day it gave birth to a female calf and started giving abundant amounts of milk. Although the family searched the region to find the owner of the cow, no one claimed it. The cow stayed with the family for years, giving birth to a calf each year and filling their buckets with sweet milk. However, one day the man forgot to be thankful and raised his staff to the cow while the cow was eating in a field of new oats. After the cow gathered all her herd together, they disappeared and were never seen again. Another type of fairy cattle was known as Calamity Meat. These cows appeared to have died accidentally but were actually stolen by fairies to increase their Otherworldly herds. The world once had a cow that was "elf-smitten," but fairies replaced it with an enchanted piece of Alder wood that looked exactly like the cow. People believed that fairies stole their livestock, leading them to think it was vital not to consume the meat of an animal that had died in a strange manner. It was common to believe that underwater fairies had their own cows that feasted on seaweed, resembling Seals or sea-lions.
