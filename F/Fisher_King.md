The Grail legends of the Fisher King British or Arthurian hero tell the tale of the wounded king who sits in a boat and fishes while the land around him withers away. This story is often seen in the context of the pure knight Percival. The king was once a virile and strong young man who made the mistake of attacking a stranger while mounted. The stranger left a part of his sharp lance in the king's groin before dying. The lance tip had the words "The Grail" inscribed on it. The king, kept alive by a magical stone, suffered in agony as he waited for someone to lift the curse. There are some who argue against any Celtic influence on this character, while others point to the Blemished King motif, where the land and its ruler are likened to a married couple, with the ruler's health affecting the soil's fertility. The Fisher King couldn't energize the earth goddess since he needed the Grail's curing power to revive himself and the land. The character shows up in T. S. Eliot's "The Waste Land" as well as in the film comedy "The Fisher King," besides appearing in works primarily based on the Grail legends. Alain le Gros sometimes appears in some texts as Percival's father, who is also referred to as the Fisher King because of his biblical miracle reproduction. He used one fish to feed a multitude of people and erected the castle of Corbenic as a home for the Grail. Other names for the Fisher King include Anfortas ("infirmity"), Alain, Bron, Pelles, and Rothniam.
