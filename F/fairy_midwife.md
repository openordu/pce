The fairy midwife was a common theme in folklore, just like the bride, baby and musician were. Fairies found humans who were adept at helping deliver babies almost irresistible. Despite not being skilled in this craft themselves, fairies would simply take what they needed from their human neighbors and kidnap the best midwife they could find, rather than hiring one or asking a friend to serve in that capacity. Occasionally, they'd leave an enchanted stick or elderly fairy to take her place, but often the midwife would simply vanish. After the child was safely born, the midwife would be returned to her home and family with a fine reward for her help, unless she accidentally rubbed her eye with the Fairy Ointment, which would blind her in punishment. One of the most famous fairy midwives was Biddy Mannion of Inishshark island in Ireland. She was kidnapped by the king and queen of the fairies to care for their sickly child. Biddy served well, leaving a thriving fairy infant behind when she returned home. An enchantment was cast on a fairy substitute so that not even Biddy's own family had realized her absence.
