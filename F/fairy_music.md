In Irish folklore, fairies have an affinity for music similar to their human counterparts. They relish the sound of a good tune and have been known to abduct skilled musicians, particularly pipers and harpers, to provide entertainment for their fairy revelries. The musicians are brought back to earth the following morning, having been compensated with an otherworldly and mesmerizing tune known as Planxty. This rhythmic irregularity is characteristic of fairy music and distinguishes it from compositions made by mortals. An example of this transformation can be seen in the story of Turlough O’Carolan, a harper who was only mediocre in skill until he spent a night sleeping on a Fairy Rath or within a Fairy Ring, where he woke up filled with enchanted music that he played until the end of his life. Fairy music is often heard during the hours between midnight and dawn emanating from Fairy Mounds or other hidden sources, enveloping the listener in an all-encompassing sound of laughter. Openings into FairyLAND can suddenly appear in unlikely places such as a dark spot on a Bog, the side of a big boulder, a small wild field or beneath a Fairy Tree. Few people were able to escape the allure of the fairy dance and returned to the human world, as they were overwhelmed with the desire to join in the celebration. Fairy music was always lively and upbeat, causing people to tap their feet and move their bodies in dance. Tales abound about humans who were so completely taken over by fairy music that they danced endlessly without being able to stop. In Fairyland, this presented no harm, as the dancers remained strong and youthful despite the years passing them by. However, if someone was cursed to dance endlessly here on earth, they would eventually die from the exertion. The fairies were known for their musical abilities, and there is some disagreement about which instrument was their favorite - while some claim it was the bagpipe, others say it was the harp. According to certain legends, fairyland was a kind of music school for talented pipers and harpers to hone their skills, and only the very best were taken away without a trace. Many who lived in places known to be fairy-haunted were bothered by the fairy music emanating from these areas - in some stories, their possessions were even scattered by the Fairy Blast. In Scottish folklore, there is a story of a man who built his house on an ancient Hillfort and was unable to sleep due to the constant music until he moved away. However, he did learn several tunes by heart before relocating.
