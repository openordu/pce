The fairy, of Irish origin, were once considered divine. They were the descendants of the goddess Danu, known as the Tuatha Dé Danann. The Tuatha Dé invaded Ireland and took control from the Fir Bolg and the Fomorians, the previous inhabitants. After the Sons of Míl (also known as the Milesians) defeated the Tuatha Dé in the battle of Tailtiu, they agreed on a treaty whereby the Tuatha Dé were allowed to live in the underground world, while the Milesians would rule the surface. As a result, the Tuatha Dé transformed into the fairy people and lived in the liminal areas of Ireland, such as the hills and under the bogs. The fairies were said to be fallen angels, drawing a connection to the Christian story of the fallen angels. Although some of the divinities of the Tuatha Dé Danann feature in Irish fairy lore, like Clídna, Macha, and Midir, others do not appear in the tales. The mythological history of the Tuatha Dé, as described in the Book Of Invasions, is different from actual fairy lore, which has been orally transmitted until it was recorded by folklorists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. No one can say whether the Dagda and Brigit, among other divinities, lived under hills as tales of their existence in Ireland are mere conjecture. The inhabitants of the Otherworld were not commonly identified as either fairies or Tuatha Dé Danann, and their human neighbors preferred using Irish expressions like Daoine Maithe (the Good People), Áes Sídhe (People of the Fairy Mounds), and Daoine Uaisle (the Gentry) to refer to them instead. Other alternative names were also used, including the Wee Folk, Hill Crowd, Red Caps, and the Host of the Air, which William Butler Yeats employed as the title for one of his most noteworthy earlier poems.
