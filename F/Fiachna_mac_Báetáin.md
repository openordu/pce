A potential historical king named Fiachna mac Báetáin was aided in achieving victory by his wife Caíntigern who slept with the sea god Manannán Mac Lir. It is believed that Manannán Mac Lir, who was greatly desirous of Caíntigern, arranged for Fiachna to win the battle in exchange for her. Fiachna's genealogical history implies a divine or totem ancestor, as he was reportedly conceived in a parthenogenetic manner by his mother.
