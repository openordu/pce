The Celts viewed trees as significant symbols in their religion, and believed that most species had magical properties in some fashion. However, none were more closely associated with fairies than the Thorn or hawthorn due to its spiky thorns, white blossoms, and distinctive red haws or berries, which were said to have been favored by the Good People. Fairy thorns that marked fairy lands included those growing from the top of ancient mounds or raths, those growing alone in a field of stones, those growing in a group of three, and those growing next to an Oak and Ash tree to create the most magical of groves. Legends abound of the unfortunate fate that befell those who dared cut down a fairy tree, with one 20th-century tale recounting how a planned hospital in Co. Mayo that would have required the removal of two fairy trees was almost thwarted when no one would agree to cut either one down. Eventually, a man was found who was willing to try and suffered a stroke (see Fairy Stroke) the next day as a result. However, the hospital was built without incident. In contrast, the American-owned DeLorean car factory built in Ulster experienced problems and some believe it was due to being built on the sacrificed roots of a fairy tree. Fairy trees are still believed in by some in Ireland, as evidenced by the 1999 global attention drawn to a well-known fairy thorn tree in County Clare. The tree's grave would have been built over by a road if a local schoolmaster named Eddie Lenihan had not campaigned for its redirection. The ongoing respect for fairies in Ireland is displayed through the still-standing fairy thorn of Newmarket-on-Fergus on Shannon Airport's main road.
