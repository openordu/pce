Folklore holds a mythical belief that time passed differently in Fairyland than on earth. Fairy time moved quickly whereas time spent on earth was endless. It is said that spending an evening at a fairy dance was equivalent to centuries of human time. Several tales narrate incidents of people getting carried away or abducted into fairyland and appearing to have spent only a short time, only to come back and find everything changed. The well-known poet Oisín, a member of the heroic group Fianna and lover of the beautiful Niamh of the Golden Hair, is one such example. His time spent with her was a never-ending bliss, but he grew homesick for the earth eventually. Despite Niamh’s reservations, he made his way back to meet his old friends, yet he encountered everything was different. The Ireland of old times had vanished and church steeples stood tall. Distraught and bewildered, he forgot Niamh’s warning not to touch the earth's soil. Leaning off his horse, he fell, and at that very instant, all the years he had lived caught up with him, and he withered, died and turned to dust.
