Fintan mac Bóchra, an ancient Irishman, was the sole survivor of a flood that brought the seafaring queen Cesair and her 50 women to Ireland. The Book Of Invasions records that the women were accompanied by only three men, two of whom "perished of embraces," while Fintan, to escape, fled. He subsequently assumed various forms, including that of an Eagle, a hawk, and the one-eyed Salmon Goll Essa Ruaid. Bards such as Amairgin and Tuan Mac Cairill, as well as the stories of various divinities, also display this Shape-Shifting ability.
