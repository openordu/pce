One motif that commonly appears in folklore is the fairy stroke. Nowadays, if someone loses their control over a part of, or their entire body, we would say that they have suffered a stroke. However, in the past, people believed that full or partial paralysis was a form of punishment from the Fairies. It was thought that they could inflict punishment with just a touch. Offenses such as felling a Fairy Tree, allowing cattle to graze in a Fairy Ring, or even stealing something belonging to them could lead to Fairy retribution. The Fairy's stroke was said to be powerful enough to paralyze the strongest of individuals, and as such, people were fearful of it. This belief was so strong that many places of legendary significance, such as Fairy Mounds, were protected for generations due to the fear of punishment.
