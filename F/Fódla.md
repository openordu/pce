Irish mythology has recorded the three goddesses of the magical race, the Tuatha Dé Danann, who met the mortal Milesians at the time of the final invasion into Ireland. Fódla, Fodla, Fodhla, or Fóta is one of these goddesses. These goddesses asked the invaders to name the land after them, providing the invaders with safe passage in return. Fódla met the invaders at Slieve Felim, a mountain in Co. Limerick. On the other hand, some sources suggest it could have been near Mauher Slieve, which is dedicated to an obscure goddess named Ébhlinne, who might possibly be Fódla under another name. Banba met the invaders on her mountain, Slieve Mis, and offered the same deal as Fódla, which was accepted. The most impressive and wealthy goddess in this event was Ériu. Consequently, Ireland (Érinn) got its name from her. Other versions suggest that Fódla owned Uisneach, but this claim shows a conflation of the three goddesses of the land. Fódla was married to Mac Cécht, a warrior of her tribe. She was killed at the Battle of Tailtiu, which saw the victory of the Milesians over the Tuatha dé Danann.
