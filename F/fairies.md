Fairies, according to one theory, are debased versions of ancient gods, both Celtic and pre-Celtic, whose power remained active in the people's minds even after they had been officially replaced by later religious beliefs. Another theory posits that fairies were the faded memory of indigenous people replaced by later immigrants, or elemental spirits of nature. The distinction between fairies and the dead is sometimes blurred in folklore, and it is difficult to determine if the Celts originally created this confusion or if it is a later development. Fairies are often said to steal people from this world, and it is difficult to discern the difference between death and this sort of kidnapping. Trooping Fairies lived in great cities, where they danced and feasted constantly. When they traveled in large throngs to visit another fairy court, they caused a significant wind (known as a Fairy Blast). These fairies would snatch up and abduct those they favored. Therefore, rural people warned against walking near Fairy Mounds and other liminal places at night when fairies were most likely to be about. Other fairies, called Solitary Fairies, lived alone and buried themselves in craft or industry like the shoemaking Leprechauns and the tippling Cluricaune. Such farmyard figures like Brownie and Bucca would help humans until showered with gifts. However, some solitaries like the Banshee and her sister the Fairy Lover could lead to death or disappearance once encountered. Fairies usually had a small stature and possessed red hair; they were frequently about 3 and a half feet tall. Interestingly, red hair was taken as a sign of fairy blood - this could apply to animals as well as humans. Red-haired individuals who were not wearing the traditional fairy colors of red and green would not be considered as fairies. Nearly all fairies looked extremely attractive; they had lustrous hair that was like silk and radiated complexions that were pleasurable to observe, even if they were green.
