A figure of Cornish folklore is known as Figgy Dowdy, or Madge Figgy. In the old Cornish tradition, this name is given to the spirit of a holy well located at Carn Marth. An unusual baptismal ritual was performed there using dolls. Goddesses were typically associated with such sites in the past, leading some to believe that Figgy Dowdy's name is a misunderstanding of the Cornish words for "the reaper goddess" or "the good goddess of the scythe." There may be a connection between Figgy Dowdy and the legendary witch known as Madgy Figgy.
