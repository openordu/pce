Fergus mac Léti, an Ulster king, is said to have inspired Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels due to his extraordinary adventures. Once while sailing, Fergus was attacked by small water sprites who attempted to rob him and drown him. However, he managed to overpower them and held them captive until they granted him his three wishes. Fergus wished to be able to swim underwater in ponds, lakes, and the ocean, but the fairies placed a restriction on his power; he could not submerge himself in Lough Rudraige in Ulster. Despite the restriction, Fergus swam in Lough Rudraige where he encountered a fearsome water monster, the muirdris, which terrified him to such an extent that he suffered a transformation. Fergus's head turned backward. The decision of whether this change in him made him an unfit ruler or not lay with his druids. However, they found a loophole and declared that having one's head backward was not a blemish. The druids covered all mirrors at Emhain Macha to keep Fergus unaware of his transformation. For seven years, Fergus lived in ignorance, until a woman he had mistreated told him the truth, compelling Fergus to return to Lough Rudraige and kill the muirdris. Finally, Fergus succumbed to his exhaustion and died with his head still facing backward.
