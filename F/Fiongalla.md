Obscure and mysterious, Fiongalla is a heroic figure in Irish lore. Hailing from the southwest province of Munster, she was bewitched by the powerful Druid Amerach from Ulster, a woman who defied the years and remained ageless. Amerach demanded that Fiongalla vow to never lie with a man until she received the magical Yew berries, Holly boughs, and marigolds. Only when the task was completed by the hero Feargal did Amerach lose her hold over Fiongalla.
