A well-known motif in Irish folklore is the fairy mist, which resembles the Druid's Fog that provided individuals with camouflage. The fairy mist emerged without warning, particularly at night or in desolate locations such as bogs, and was regarded as particularly perilous. According to certain myths, being encircled by this mist foreshadowed death.
