Fintan, the salmon named Goll Essa Ruaid or "the one-eyed one of the red waterfall", lived in a pool at the beginning of one of Ireland's rivers, which could be either the Boyne or the Erne. He fed on the enchanted Hazel nuts that fell from the bushes near the water. Fintan was captured by the Druid Finnéces and was eaten unintentionally by the renowned hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. This event led to Fionn gaining immense wisdom.
