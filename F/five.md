Three and five were the most significant numbers to Celtic peoples. Three represented intensification while five represented a natural order since there are five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot. The number five may have been the basis of the early Irish counting system. This can be observed in various mythological contexts such as the five-pointed spear of the Connacht king Ailill mac MÃ¡ta, the five sacred names of the hill of Tara, the five warriors who simultaneously killed the hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. The smallest family unit, called the geilfine, consisted of five people. Geographically, Ireland divided the island into five mythological Provinces, with Mide as the central one. This was a magically situated center around which the other four were located. Therefore, five can be seen as a magically enhanced version of four, which is the number of wholeness as well as a naturally occurring number with its own innate power.
