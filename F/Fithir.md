The king of Leinster became enamored by Fithir, an Irish heroine renowned for her beauty. However, Túathal Techtmar, Fithir's father, refused the king's request to marry her, and instead, the king wed Fithir's older sister, Dáirine. Curiously, Dáirine supposedly died soon after. When the king returned to ask for Fithir's hand again, she agreed. However, upon discovering that her sister was imprisoned with her handmaidens in a tower surrounded by a dense and ominous forest, Fithir died from shock and embarrassment.
