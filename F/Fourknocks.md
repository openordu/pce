A remarkable site in the Irish midlands is Fourknocks, boasting a size that surpasses many other Megalithic Civilization relics. Although most Passage Graves are compact and fit only a handful of individuals within their inner chambers, the enormous mound at Fourknocks could comfortably accommodate over two dozen people. The site's decor includes lintels that feature zigzag carvings. For information on Fairy Ointment, see Four-Leafed Clover.
