Fairy crafts present a folkloric theme. Fairies were known to lead carefree lives revolving around dancing and feasting, although some fairies held professions. One prominent fairy in Irish folklore is the Leprechaun, who served as the shoemaker for fairies and was a solitary figure constantly occupied with providing the dancing troupes with shoes. Fairy women were reputed for their exceptional spinning and weaving abilities and often evaluated the skills of human women in these areas.
