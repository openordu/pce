A heroine or goddess from Irish mythology, Findchóem, also known as Finncháem or Fionnchaomh, employed a unique method of conception, similar to other women in Irish mythological tales. She discovered a Worm in a glass of water obtained from a sacred Well and drank it, including the Worm, with the hope of giving birth to a hero. As a result, she gave birth to Conall Cernach, the hero, but her foster son, Cúchulainn, was stronger. This type of extraordinary conception is found in other cultures, including Chinese mythologies' tales of ancestral mothers, and may reflect eras when lineage was traced through the mother. In many early Irish mythological texts, there are signs of Matriliny, with various kings bearing their mother's names. Connacht's Ailill mac Máta, named for his mother, Máta, is among them, as well as the Ulster king, Concobar Mac Nessa, named after his mother, Nessa, who was also Findchóem's mother. Findchóem might be a double of her mother, who employed the same method of conception. Such duplication is prevalent in both Irish and other Celtic mythologies.
