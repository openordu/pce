Fairy dart, also known as fairy arrow or saighead sithe, is a minuscule arrow commonly found littering the ground near fairy haunts in Scotland and Ireland. These arrows were believed to be originally prehistoric flintheads. According to folklore, fairy smiths created these arrows specifically to harm humans, despite their tiny size. As per an Isle of Skye story, a couple who were reaping by moonlight found their tools falling from their bleeding hands without any apparent reason. They later discovered tiny arrows hurled at them by the fairy folk when they got too close to the Good People’s secret haunts. Scottish tradition indicates that being hit by these arrows would result in Fairy Kidnapping, where the person's outer shell remained or appeared to die, but his or her true self was trapped in FairyLAND. Cows struck by these arrows would eat like other animals, but would produce no milk. The dart was believed to be crafted with hellish help by the fairy smiths and sharpened and polished by the devil. The tiny weapon was thrown by fairies towards people and animals, mostly as a form of retribution for treading on their property or to make mischief. The dart's impact was undetectable, but the victim's hands would swell soon after with excruciating arthritis making the fairy wound hard to diagnose. The wound inflicted by a fairy dart was lethal if not treated. There existed a number of remedies to counteract its ill effects. The most potent of these was to locate the wounding dart and submerge it below water before taking a sip. If the dart was too minuscule to find, the next best option was to use a Mary Candle. The Mary Candle involved taking a candle and drawing it three times around an animal’s forelegs or a person’s torso, followed by three times around the belly, and then finally three times around the hind legs. This ritual required two individuals, and involved making the sign of the cross with each pass around the cow. Upon completion, they would pass the candle along the cow’s backbone and end with the sign of the cross again, between the horns. However, the Mary Candle was effective only if the fairy dart had not punctured the animal’s heart. If such were the case, death was inevitable.
