Celtic ritual, the feast (féis), was a significant event in the ancient Celtic world. Feasts were more than just mere celebrations with plentiful food and drinks; they marked seasonally important dates such as the beginning of winter on Samhain (November 1), spring’s awakening on Imbolc (February 1), the start of summer on Beltane (May 1), and the harvest feast on Lughnasa (August 1). Although little is known about the ancient Celtic's methods of celebration, certain beliefs can be deduced by analyzing folklore and tradition.
