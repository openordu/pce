Underground stone chambers can be found in Cornwall. These are known as fogous and are believed to have been built between 500 B.C.E. and 500 C.E. They are thought to have been used for ritualistic purposes. While there is evidence to suggest occupancy by Celts in later years, it is possible these fogous were built by a different group who held pre-Celtic spiritual beliefs. One significant detail is the alignment of many fogous to the summer solstice sunrise, which indicates the use of a different calendar than that of the Celts. Some speculate that the stone chambers may have been a revival of the megalithic civilization that inspired Stonehenge. Folk legends associate fogous with otherworldly women, perhaps goddesses. Fogous frequently have secret chambers within their beehive shape. Speculative reconstructions focus on the notion of the smaller chambers being utilized for initiation ceremonies or other similar ceremonies.
