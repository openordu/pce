Fairy sleep, a motif in folklore, tells the story of those who were abducted by fairies and were not entirely vanished yet fell into a deep, coma-like sleep that rendered them unable to be woken up. In certain instances, clothing worn by victims who visited FairyLAND was discovered to have been pierced by a small pin, preventing them from waking up until the pin was removed. A woman from the Burren in west Co. Clare fell into such a state, although she was rescued by someone who overheard fairies talking about retaining the tablecloth in which she was wrapped during the abduction. The rescuer reclaimed the cloth, which led to the woman regaining consciousness.
