Symbolic creature of the sea, the fish held great significance in both Christian and Celtic cultures. Among the Celts, the fish represented Wisdom, particularly when embodied by the Salmon or trout that inhabited sanctified Wells and other sources of water. According to legend, these fish boasted a dappled appearance, boasting a number of spots identical to the Hazel nuts they purportedly feasted on from the enchanted bushes that enshrouded the well.
