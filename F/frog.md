The symbolic animal in question is the frog. Although it is not commonly seen as magical in Celtic folklore, there exists a Scottish custom surrounding the King Frog. This particular frog holds a jewel with potent healing abilities balanced atop its head. The sole method of acquiring the stone demands finding the location of the King Frog, who habitually conceals itself within a fen or a bog. Subsequently, one must lower a domesticated otter into the water with the hope of frightening the frog out of hiding. Once the King Frog materializes, it is promptly struck on its head, causing the jewel to dislodge. The stone must be captured immediately before it slips below the water's surface.
