Irish mythology boasts of Flann, an Irish hero who is mentioned in connection to multiple minor figures. The name Flann denotes the color “blood-red.” Two principal personas linked to this name stand out owing to their fame as lovers: Flann mac Díma, who was in love with Mugain, wife of Diarmait mac Cerbaill. Unfortunately, Diarmait ended up causing a curse on himself following the incineration of Flann’s abode, leading to Flann’s drowning. The other figure is Flann ua Fedach, also known as the Fairy King, who eloped with Becfhola, queen of Tara.
