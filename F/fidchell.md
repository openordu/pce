An ancient game called fidchell, similar to today's cribbage, involved moving pegs around a board. The name, which means "wood wisdom," suggests that the pegs were likely made of wood. Fidchell was also a game of strategy, akin to chess, in which the goal was to capture the opponent's pieces. While no surviving gameboards exist, fidchell makes frequent appearances in Irish mythology, notably when fairy king Midir wagered against King Eochaid Airem of Tara for the prize of Queen Étain.
