Father to the accomplished Emer - considered the most beautiful woman in Ireland - Forgall Manach was an Irish hero who played a pivotal role in the Ulster Cycle. He is known for his attempts to obstruct Cúchulainn's romantic pursuits. Forgall, who earned the nickname "the wily one," had sent Cúchulainn to train on the Isle of Skye under the tutelage of Scáthach, the Warrior Woman. With Scáthach running the world's finest martial arts academy, Forgall's actions ensured that his daughter's husband would become the most celebrated hero in all of Ireland.
