A hero of Irish heritage, Fionn Mac Cumhaill, lived as a young student with Finnéces, a druid. Although there are varying accounts of their location, they were situated near a mystical pool where Hazel bushes would drop their nuts into the water, providing nourishment to the Salmon who swam there. Finnéces had been waiting for seven years to obtain the wisdom that was held within the fish, and when the opportune moment arrived, he caught it with ease. Leaving Fionn to watch the cooking fish, he warned the boy not to touch or taste it. Despite Finnéces’ warnings, some of the sizzling salmon landed on Fionn’s thumb, causing him to put his thumb in his mouth to ease the pain. Wisdom immediately flowed into Fionn, the very same wisdom sought after by the old druid. The Welsh story of the bard Taliesin is similar, where the Cauldron of the goddess Ceridwen holds wisdom and it is the boy named Gwion who steals it. The names Gwion and Fionn are cognate, and Finnéces shares similarities with Fionn, as does the Salmon with the name Fintan. Some suggest a doubling of the same figure due to these similarities.
