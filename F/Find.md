Irish mythology is steeped in the word “white,” or “Find,” appearing in the names of many mythological figures and folk heroes. Scholars have found evidence of an early divinity known by this name, although it is unclear whether it referred to a particular figure or the radiant nature of divinity itself. This divinity may have been a god who preceded the famous Fionn Mac Cumhaill or a goddess in connection with Bóand, the white cow goddess who lends her name to the River Boyne. The geographer Ptolemy, in the second century C.E., mentioned Bouvinda, a divinity whose name is linked to the magical cow Bó Find, possibly an aspect of Bóand. Whether the word “Find” could be a name or a title is still a subject of debate.
