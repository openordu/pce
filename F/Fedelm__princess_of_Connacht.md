Met one morning while bathing in the sacred Spring of Ogalla were Fedelm, princess of Connacht, and her sister Eithne. The sisters encountered white-clad men whom they mistook for Druids, but who were actually St. Patrick and his followers. The story depicts a series of questions the sisters asked Patrick, revealing fascinating insights into the pantheism of ancient Celtic religion. Among other things, they asked whether their god resided in Nature or not. The tale concludes with the sisters accepting baptism from Patrick and expiring quite immediately, thus resorting to heaven in immaculate purity. One may find it hard not to interpret this legend as propaganda because Eithne and Fedelm are dominant goddess names of the area.
