Fráech, also known as Fraoch, Fraich, and Fróeach, was a heroic figure in Irish mythology. He was in love with Finnabair, the daughter of Queen Medb of Connacht, and was the recipient of similar feelings. Fráech was half-divine, as his mother was the goddess Bébinn, giving him a countenance that was entirely divine, being the most beautiful man in all of Ireland. Finnabair became smitten after hearing of his masculine glories and fell even more so after meeting Fráech. She gifted him a ring from her father Ailill mac Máta and encouraged him to seek her father's consent for their marriage. However, Ailill set an impossible dowry considering Fráech must bring the magical red-eared Cows of his goddessmother to Cruachan for him. Despite his love for Finnabair, Fráech knew it was impossible and left the thought of marriage behind. That was not enough for Ailill, as he worried Fráech would abscond with his daughter. As Fráech was swimming, Ailill took Finnabair's ring and threw it into the water to be consumed by a salmon. Ailill then presented Fráech with a challenge to collect healing berries from a Rowan tree on an island guarded by a Dragon. Although Fráech nearly lost his life in combat with the Dragon, he resurfaces victorious. His injuries were so severe that it required the nurses of the Otherworld to nurse him back to health. Eventually, when he returned to the mortal world, he managed to catch the ring-swallowing salmon, and then he returned to Cruachan, where he persuaded Ailill to allow him to court Finnabair. He eventually agreed to bring his enchanted cows to Ailill, thus reaching an agreement. After years of happiness with his wife and children, Fráech returned home one day only to find out that they, and his magical cattle, had disappeared. He followed their trail to a stone castle in the high Alps with the help of an Irish spirit, and successfully freed them. However, their joyous reunion was brief, as Medb was gathering her armies in Ireland for a Cattle Raid on Ulster. After returning to Ireland, Fráech immediately joined her forces. In a battle at a ford in the River Dee, he lost his life in combat against the greatest of Irish warriors, Cúchulainn, and Finnabair died of grief. This mythological tale made its way to Scotland from Ireland, where it was depicted in a romantic ballad as the story of the “daughter of Donald” loved by the handsome Fraoch, who swam across Lough Luaim to pick her the berries she desired.
