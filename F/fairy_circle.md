Folkloric motif - the fairy circle - reveals that after Fairies danced upon the dewy grass, a perfect circle remained. Although they are naturally occurring rings of green caused by biological agents such as fungus, they were thought to be enchanted and even dangerous. It was ill-advised to sleep in a fairy circle because the fairies might return and carry off the sleeping person, a phenomenon known as Fairy Kidnapping. Cattle were guided from the circles, and it was believed, without reason that they were poisonous.
