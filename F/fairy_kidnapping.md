Folklore often depicts the fairies as thieves who regularly pilfer from humans. However, the most unsettling thing that fairies could do to humans was the act of fairy kidnapping or snatching individuals. Fairy theft, on the other hand, did not involve the unexplained disappearance of individuals, as families could more easily live without their butter than their mother. Fairies tended to steal things that are considered the best in our world, such as the sweetest cream and the most talented musicians. Therefore, various rituals and verbal formulas were created to deter the attention of the fairy realm, including the practice of giving loved ones nicknames, believing that revealing someone's real name would attract fairy kidnappers to that person. Although fairies could abduct anyone, certain categories of individuals were at a higher risk. For instance, our charming infants were greatly vulnerable as fairy babies were rare and exceedingly unsightly at birth. Fairies would sometimes steal babies, leaving either an enchanted rock or stick or an unsightly fairy (see Changeling) in the infant's place. To prevent this, new mothers in the Isle of Man made sure to place their husband's trousers in their bed to scare the fairies away. Fairies also desired beautiful young people, and brides could be taken away on their wedding day before consummation (see Fairy Bride). Further, handsome young men could disappear while walking with a Red-haired girl (see Fairy Lover). Talented poets and musicians of exceptional ability were frequently abducted for their skills, taken against their will to amuse the fairy court at one of the many never-ending balls. However, once the Good Folk had their fill of their entertainment, they would simply discard them. Those who were abandoned in this way by the fairies, often longed for the enchanting place they had left behind and quickly perished on their return to human life. Those who were hardier, if caught stealing the magical ointment that allowed them to see the fairy beings with human eyes (see Fairy Ointment), would be subjected to a different kind of punishment.
