A recurring element in folklore is the fairy blast, also referred to as fairy wind or elfin eddy. As the Trooping Fairies traveled together, the force of their movement produced a gust of wind that could be felt even in the human world. During summer months, it was possible to observe the fairies as they stirred up dust and straw, even on the calmest of days. Yet, this whirlwind concealed a more sinister purpose - Fairy Kidnapping. As the troop passed by, objects and living beings would vanish from our reality. However, if one were to throw a left shoe at the vortex, anything that the fairies had taken would fall from their grasp. A variety of alternatives, such as bonnets, knives, and earth from molehills, could act as substitutes for the shoe, provided that the words "that's yours, this is mine" were uttered while throwing the object. Nevertheless, it was unwise to try to deceive the fairies and reclaim something that rightfully belonged to them, such as their remarkable bagpipes. In such cases, the magic item would disintegrate into dust or transform into natural debris when touched by humans. The force of the fairy blast was so great that it could even pick up fully-grown individuals and transport them over great distances. Those who walked along Fairy Paths, or wandered onto them, were most vulnerable to kidnapping, especially if they travelled at night. Tales of people who found themselves abruptly transported to remote places, like London, New York, or inaccessible ice regions, were common. No mention is made of the individual responsible, but it was reported that some prisoners were released back to their point of origin. However, this was not always a successful endeavor as the extended duration of their absence or other factors, such as mental confusion resulting from exposure to harsh environments, caused them to be unable to identify their former location. Additionally, in some cases, the place they knew had been altered so much as to be unrecognizable.
