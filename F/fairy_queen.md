Folkloric figure, the fairy queen reigns over Fairyland, a monarchy. While some fairy kings exist in literature and legend, goddess figures like Áine, Clídna or Fand are the most common royalty of the Otherworld. This tradition was reflected in the works of two important authors, Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare. Spenser penned The Faerie Queene, an allegorical poem, while residing in Ireland, while Shakespeare introduced Titania, companion to Oberon in A Midsummer Night’s Dream.
