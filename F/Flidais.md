An Irish goddess by the name of Flidais (also known as Flidas or Fliodhas), was worshipped by many European cultures. She resembles Greek goddess Artemis, Roman goddess Diana and continental Celtic Artio. Flidais symbolized Fertility and abundance. As the goddess of wild beasts, Flidais’ name meant “doe,” and she rode in a chariot which was drawn by Deer. The goddess of domestic herds, Flidais had a magical Cow which produced enough Milk to feed 30 people each night. Flidais' sexual behavior matched her animal nature since she was as voracious as her consort, the randy Fergus Mac Róich. When Flidais wasn't interested, Fergus made do with seven ordinary women. It is said that she was married to the fairy Ádammair, though nothing else is known about him. Flidais' daughters shared her temperament - Bé Chuille, was ousted from Fairyland due to her promiscuity; Bé Téite was another woman famous for her debauchery, of whom little legend remains. Finally, Fand, Flidais’ daughter was a wild fairy, who abducted Cúchulainn, Emer’s husband.
