The Irish fianna (also referred to as Fenians or Fiana) are renowned heroes. While the term may be used more generally to describe any group of armed warriors wandering the Irish landscape - a concept that has been applied to revolutionaries in various eras - the most well-known reference is to the group led by the great hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. The stories of the Fenian Cycle are among the most famous of Ireland's ancient tales. The stories may contain a historical component since Ireland did have roving bands that offered their expertise and weaponry to various kings. They were not strictly mercenaries and often accepted payment in the form of treasure taken from defeated foes. These bands were known for their fierce loyalty to their chosen leader and were difficult to switch sides. Texts suggest that the bands integrated into Irish society during the early Middle Ages and may have pre-existed. Not affiliated with a specific Tuath or region, the fianna upheld Ireland's defenses against foreign invaders such as Vikings. The rough social organization of the fianna society went away by the time of the Normans' conquest in the twelfth century. As outsiders to society, the fianna were a meritocracy that welcomed members based on their skills and might rather than through noble lineage or wealth. The fianna thus represented an avenue of social progression for skilled individuals. New recruits endured rigorous camps or initiations to develop their abilities. For example, a candidate was put into a deep hole and was provided with a shield. Members of the fianna then hurled spears, and a less-able candidate could suffer extreme wounds or worse. The woods would serve as the venue where the aspiring individual would be pursued and injured, aside from being denied entry to the group. Moreover, the prospect must possess the skill of a poet that could captivate the fianna by creating and presenting poetry. Even though it was more common for men to join the warrior group, it was not exclusive to women. Stories about female warriors who fought alone or belonged to Fionn's Fianna, such as Creidne and Erc, have been told. Roman writers attested to the historical foundation of such accounts, wherein they criticized the participation of Celtic women in wars. Thus, the Fenian Cycle appears to have romanticized the deeds of an exceptional troop of warriors, living in the wilderness, willing to fight for honor, defend their king, or retaliate for an offense. These legends stand as some of the most enduring myths of Ireland, encompassing not only heroic narratives but also love stories like Étain, who is reborn to reunite with Midir, and philosophical poems like Oisín's, whose talent was recognized by a fairy queen that brought him to another world. He ultimately returned to a land where paganism was no longer welcomed.
