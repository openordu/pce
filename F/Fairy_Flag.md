The Fairy Flag is a renowned Scottish folkloric symbol. Housed at Dunvegan Castle, which belongs to the MacLeod clan, on the Isle of Skye off Scotland, it is one of the most famous relics of Fairyland seen in our world. It is said that on a fall evening, a Green-clad woman entered the nursery of the castle and found the infant heir sleeping soundly, while his nurse was also napping. Typically, such a caller would be suspected of planning a Fairy Kidnapping, but the woman sat down and began to sing a beautiful air called "Taladh na Mna Sithe," or "Lullaby of the Fairy Woman." The nurse awoke but was immobilized by fright as she watched the fairy woman wrap the child delicately in a silken garment. The woman subsequently vanished, leaving the child unharmed. When the nurse took the child to his parents in the great banqueting hall to tell the strange tale, everyone's attention was caught by the mysterious fairy blanket. It became the distinctive banner of the MacLeods and is claimed to protect all members of the clan when they go to battle. Every nurse to the MacLeods had to learn the lullaby of the fairy woman, as it was thought to weave a magical protective spell around the children. Another version of the origin of the Fairy Flag is that a magical woman from the Holy Land gave it to the MacLeods, declaring that the unfurled flag would cast a Glamour that made each soldier appear to be an entire battalion. A fairy woman once visited this world to be with one of the chiefs of the MacLeods. It is said that the woman could not bear to stay away from her homeland and was forced to leave the man. On abandoning the chief, the fairy woman left the Fairy Flag as a token of her love.
