A figure from Irish folklore is the Toice bhrean bear tiqhe or fairy housekeeper. In Co. Limerick, at the enchanting Lough Gur, a peculiar entity dwells. Every seven years, the water from the lake withdraws, exposing the fairy housekeeper. This figure walks towards a chair made of stone and sits there for a brief period before vanishing along with the lake's reappearance.
