Magical creatures of fairy tales were a common motif in folklore. In Fairyland, the fairies had fantastical Cattle, which are now known as Fairy Cows, as well as Dogs, which are now known as Black Dogs, and Cats, which are now known as Cat Sith, that looked similar to the ones found in our world. Along with them, there were other extraordinary creatures that existed partially in our world and partially in the Otherworld. These creatures included Horses that lived in the ocean, or Water Horses, and Seals that took human form, or Silkies. Additionally, there were monstrous beings, such as Afanc, as well as less frightening yet still improbable creatures like Kelpies. These entities were not necessarily under the control of the fairies, but their Otherworldly origins bound them to the fairies.
