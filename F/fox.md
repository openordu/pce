Symbolic animal, the wily fox, in the Cotswolds was linked with an equally clever human, the Witch, who was able to take on its form to steal butter from her neighbors and cause chaos in the area. Due to the fox's reputation in farming communities for stealing valuable chicken flocks at night, it was easy for people to connect it with the evil witch and her thieving ways, resulting in being targeted by their anger.
