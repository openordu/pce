A figure in Scottish folklore, Garb Mac Stairn, is featured in a legend about the Irish hero Cúchulainn. Garb wished to possess the hero's bull, so he journeyed to Ireland. Upon reaching Cúchulainn's house, Garb met a servant who stated that the house was empty except for the servant's ill mistress. Despite this, Garb demanded to see the house's owner and forced his way into the sickroom. There he discovered the sickly woman nursing a large baby. The giant stuck his finger into the baby's mouth, but the infant responded by biting down hard enough to draw blood. Garb and Cúchulainn, revealed to be the baby, engaged in a week-long battle that ended with the superhuman hero's victory over the fierce Scottish giant. A version of this story also exists about Finn MacCool, the folkloric equivalent of Fionn Mac Cumhaill.
