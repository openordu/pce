Obscure Galvia, a figure in Irish mythology, is said to be the princess who drowned in the river that is now named after her, and from which the contemporary Galway County derives its name. This legend is also attributed to two other goddesses, Sínann and Bóand, which suggests that Galvia may have been a significant goddess of the area's watershed in ancient times.
