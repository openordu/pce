Galahaut, the Haute Prince, was a hero in Arthurian legend. Though a minor character in the story of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table, initially he was Arthur's foe. However, after the brave Lancelot defeated him, Galahaut became a convert to Camelot. He held such loyalty and devotion to his former adversary that upon learning of Lancelotâ€™s death, the Haute Prince died of grief.
