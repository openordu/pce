A mythical weapon in Irish folklore is the Gáe Bulga (also known as Bolga or Bolg). It was bestowed upon the renowned Irish hero Cúchulainn by his teacher, the Warrior Woman, Scáthach, from the Isle of Skye. The Gáe Bulga was believed to be a type of spear or javelin, capable of slicing through flesh, which provided its bearer with a significant advantage in combat. Cúchulainn employed it to slay two of the individuals closest to his heart: his son Connla and his foster brother Ferdiad. Some experts have attributed the second component of the spear's name to the Fir Bolg, one of Ireland's ancient mythical races.
