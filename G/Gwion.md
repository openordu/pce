Gwion (also known as Gwion Bach) was a hero from Wales. The famous bard Taliesin's first incarnation was as Gwion. His adventures began when he was a young boy hired by the great witch goddess Ceridwen to help with household tasks. One of his important responsibilities was to stir the Cauldron in which Ceridwen brewed herbs for a year and a day, with the intention of making her ugly son, Afagddu, wise to compensate for his appearance. Although he was warned not to, Gwion tasted the brew, which bubbled out and burned his skin. Upon sucking his burnt finger, he inadvertently absorbed all the wisdom Ceridwen had intended for her son. In a series of transformations, Ceridwen chased him, but he ultimately turned himself into a grain of wheat, which she then consumed after transforming into a hen. This resulted in her becoming pregnant with a reborn Gwion, who later became the great poet Taliesin.
