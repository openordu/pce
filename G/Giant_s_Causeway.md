Irish mythology speaks of Giant's Causeway, a peculiar formation of basalt rocks near Portrush in Co. Coleraine. This natural wonder is considered one of Ulster's greatest wonders. According to legend, a Scottish Giant who constructed the stair-shaped rocks as the initial stage of his attack on Ireland was defeated by Finn McCool. Finn McCool is a diminished version of the legendary hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill.
