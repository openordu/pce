Arthurian tales feature Guinevere (Gwenhwyvar, Gwenhwyfar, Ganore), a hero or a goddess. Guinevere holds a central position in these tales, and this strengthens the theory that these stories of king Arthur, the quasi-historical ruler of Britain, derive from Celtic mythology. Many scholars believe that Guinevere is a thinly disguised Welsh goddess and the sad tale of her betrayal of the aging king for a noble younger man becomes another version of the common story of the king's marriage to the goddess of Sovereignty, a goddess who married one king after another, as she represented the land itself. Thus, Guinevere enacts the traditional role of the goddess by offering herself to the manly knight Lancelot. The presence of variants where Arthur marries three women, each named Guinevere, reinforces the likelihood of this queen being the Three-fold goddess. Her name (gwen, white; hwyvvar, Fairy or spirit) also links her to the Otherworld and the Irish goddess/heroine Finnabair. Her marriage to Arthur on the festival of summer's beginning, Beltane, strengthens the possibility of that being a ritual drama as opposed to a dynastic alliance. The story of Guinevere's marriage to an aging king and her later romance with a handsome knight is similar to the Irish story of fair Gr√°inne and her young lover Diarmait, who ran away with her from the aging Fionn Mac Cumhaill. The forced marriage of the young heroine Iseult to King Mark of Cornwall, despite her love for the younger Tristan, also bears resemblance. Lancelot, like Diarmait, initially tried to maintain his loyalty to his king while sleeping next to the woman he loved. He put a sword between them to deter intimacy, just as Diarmait sheltered in two separate tents. Love ultimately conquered caution and led to an affair between Lancelot and Guinevere, which split loyalties among King Arthur's knights of the Round Table. Many of them embarked on hopeless quests including the quest for the Grail. Eventually, Guinevere decided that she could no longer live with Arthur and organized her abduction. She instructed her maidens to dress in green, the color of Fairyland, on the morning of Beltane, further indicating her association with the Otherworld. Some versions of the story suggest that Arthur intended to execute Guinevere for her unfaithfulness, but Lancelot rescued her just in time. She subsequently returned to Arthur, whose kingdom, Camelot, was in ruins, with the king in combat against his mortal enemy and illegitimate son, Mordred. Although some versions of the legend blame Guinevere for the downfall of Camelot, it was Arthur who planted the seed. Arguments for interpreting Guinevere as the goddess of Sovereignty are based on early tales of Mordred abducting and marrying Guinevere to strengthen his claim to Camelot's throne, indicating that she possessed the keys to the kingdom, not Arthur. Contemporary retellings of the story, such as Marion Zimmer Bradley's bestselling Mists of Avalon, aim to redeem Guinevere, who has long been regarded with contempt.
