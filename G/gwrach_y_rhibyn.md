A figure featured in Welsh folklore is the gwrach y rhibyn. Similar to the Washer At The Ford, this Fairy woman, resembling a Banshee, would give notice of upcoming death. Her usual location was near a stream's bend or at a crossroads. The gwrach y rhibyn was a monstrous being with scarlet mother, a massive nose, and eyes that glimmered red.
