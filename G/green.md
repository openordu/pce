Symbolic in nature, green holds a special place in the hearts of the Fairy races residing in the ancient Celtic lands, often being paired with Red as the color of choice. Scottish tradition, in particular, saw many humans avoiding the color so as not to anger their fairy neighbors, with some even believing that wearing it could prove fatal. The significance of green in relation to lush plant-life can be traced back to the fairiesâ€™ beginnings as Fertility and abundance spirits.
