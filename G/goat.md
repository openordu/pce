The goat is a symbolic animal that was considered sacred to the Celts and used for sacrifice. However, goats were forbidden near the Christian abbey in Kildare due to a curse, and as the sanctuary was reserved for women, the goat may have represented the male force. Cernunnos, the horned god, was often depicted with goat legs and stag horns. In Christian imagery, the Devil was portrayed as a goat-footed being to indicate derogation of male sexual force. St. Patrick was frequently described as a goatherd which could represent Christianity’s control over male sexual instinct. The energy personified as Puck or the Pooka is a fairy being in folklore. The Puck Fair in southwestern Ireland is the most notable remnant of ancient reverence for the goat. This fair involves a white male goat crowned as king, fed cabbage, and displayed on a platform while festivities go on underneath. The fair, which originated from the Irish word poc meaning “he-goat,” lasts for three days in mid-August with Gathering Day, when the goat is crowned, Fair Day, when celebrations occur, and Scattering Day, when the goat is either sold or released into the wild. Although it has been continuously held since at least 1613, its earliest date is believed to be much earlier. However, some argue that the pagan symbolism of the rite would have caused its eradication during the period of Christianization and may claim it is a medieval or Norman invention.
