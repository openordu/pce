A well-known character in Scottish folklore is the Gray Man, also referred to as Far Liath or Liath Mhor. This giant apparition was feared for his haunting presence along the shores of both Scotland and Ireland. Believed to be the embodiment of the sea mist, travelers who found themselves lost within it were thought to be at risk of drowning. The Gray Man had a particular interest in boats containing red-haired individuals and women, but he was known to attack any passing vessel without warning.
