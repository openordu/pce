Gabriel hounds or Gabriel ratchets, gaze hounds and lyme hounds, are well-known figures in British folklore. It is believed that spectral dogs, such as the Black Dog and Pooka, disguise themselves as migrating waterbirds, specifically wild geese, and fly over while barking in bird-like voices. If these dogs circle over a house instead of continuing straight on their path, then it is seen as a sign of an impending disaster or death. This belief is an old one, as the name "ratchet" refers to a hunting hound and is linked to mythical figures such as the Banshee who foretell imminent doom. It should be noted that the name "Gabriel" is associated with Gwynn Ap Nudd, the king of the Otherworld from Welsh mythology, and not the Christian archangel.
