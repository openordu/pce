Gile, a mythical character or goddess of Irish origin, lends her name to the striking Lough Gill which is situated next to the charming town of Sligo in the west of Ireland. According to legend, Gile was enjoying a bath in a spring when her lover, Omra, arrived at the same spot. When she caught sight of him, she lowered her head under the water, and accidentally drowned. Her foster mother came upon her lifeless body and began to weep so intensely that the spring mixed with her tears to create the "vast and stormy lake," said to be Lough Gill, as described in the Dindshenchas poem that deals with place names. After this tragic event, a battle between Gile's father, the little-known Romra, and Omra took place, resulting in both men dying. Cairns are believed to have been erected over their graves, yet it remains unclear whether these are the famous ones situated atop the nearby Carns Hill. Given that Omra's and Romra's names are only one letter different, they may have been connected individuals, perhaps Twins. The story of Lough Gill, like many other tales related to Irish place names, appears to be a broken and incomplete myth, estranged from its explanatory setting.
