A plain near Garristown in County Dublin, Gabhair (also known as Gavra or Gowra) is a site of Irish mythology where the legendary Fianna, a great legion of warriors led by the epic hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill, suffered their first and final defeat. Despite their success in battle, the Fianna ultimately met their match in Gabhair, where the high king Cairbre Cinn-Chait, fed up with the Fianna's arrogance and troublemaking, finally put an end to their domination over the land. As a result of the battle, Cairbre lost his life to Oscar, Fionn's grandson who himself was also killed in the conflict.
