Irish literature often references geis (also spelled geas, geiss, ges, and in plural form, geasa or gessa), an Irish ritual vow. In accordance to this real religious custom, kings and other heroes were often required to make magical vows or pledges. Although some geasa were imposed with a clear purpose, such as preventing the king of Tara, Conaire, from eating the flesh of birds due to the belief that his mother had been cursed to take bird form, most geasa seemed frivolous. One of Conaire’s vows, for instance, prevented him from riding around Tara with his right shoulder facing the sea, prohibited him from letting Three Red horsemen ride past him to the hostel of a red man, and restricted him from being absent from Tara for over eight consecutive nights. The geasa could also be incredibly complex, as evidenced by Diarmait’s vow that hindered him from ever refusing the advances of a woman, be it day or night, and whether she came on horseback or on foot, clothed or naked. Despite their comical nature, violating a geis resulted in serious consequences, even death. The man making the vow, most often kings, did not choose the geasa imposed on him. Instead, they were inflicted by Druids or women, often substituting for the goddess of Sovereignty. Kings were held to a higher standard of sacred geasa, ensuring their integrity (See Kingship). The righteousness of a king was believed to determine the land’s fertility; if a king violated his geasa like Conaire, the land suffered and became sterile. In ancient Celtic legends and romances, heroes had an obligation to adhere to certain taboos and fulfill peculiar requests in order to maintain their strength and even their life. The performance of these obligations was tied to geasa, which were often woven into the plot of these tales.
