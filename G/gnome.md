Folkloric figures known as gnomes have been found in Celtic lands. However, they are not traditionally Celtic creatures. Instead, they were imagined by medieval science and alchemy to represent creatures of each of the four elements: fire (salamanders), water (nereids), air (sylphs), and earth (gnomes). Gnomes were believed to live underground, possibly working as miners, and the word itself may derive from “earth-dweller.” Although they are sometimes confused with creatures of authentic folklore such as Fairies and Knockers, there are no real legends attached to gnomes. In modern culture, Dwarfs from tales such as Sleeping Beauty are often seen as a variation of gnomes.
