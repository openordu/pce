A figure known by no other name than the Green Man can be found carved in stone and wood in English medieval art. This figure depicts a man's face peering out from leaves and branches, or perhaps made up of these natural elements. It is one of the most intriguing and enigmatic examples of folk belief in Celtic lands. The Green Man has been interpreted in different ways, some seeing it as representative of a guardian spirit of the corn or a masculine force of abundance. Most of the Green Man faces appear to be mild or even benevolent, although some display an angry or threatening expression, and a few seem intoxicated. A similar male figure, known as Silvanus, was used as an ornament in Roman times. Although it is unknown whether this figure had any religious significance, it may have represented the woodland god Silvanus. The Green Man face in Britain is notable in that the leaves are not simply decoration but part of the face, which either emerges from or dissolves into the leaves. Unfortunately, the myth or legend that defined the meaning of the Green Man has been lost, but vestiges of it may still be found in literature and folk tradition. The Knight that Gawain encounters in the medieval poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is often considered a literary reflection of this figure. The Green Man may be represented in real life by the dancer called Jack-In-The-Green, who wears a mask made of leaves during some British festivals celebrated on Beltane, May 1.
