Breton hero Guénolé, also known as Guénole, Gwénnolé, or Winwaloe, is remembered as the abbot of Ys - the doomed city of pagan princess Dahut. Despite saving Dahut's father, Gradlon, Guénolé condemned Dahut to her death beneath the waves of the sea. Figures like Guénolé were introduced into Celtic mythology with the arrival of Christianity and are sometimes rooted in ancient elemental divinity, which was later transformed and humanized. As Guénolé is closely tied with the sea, some suggest that he may have taken on certain characteristics of an ancient sea god. Conversely, he may represent the influence of Christian morality on Celtic culture.
