The Gorgon, a Greek goddess, was a commonly recognized symbol for the Romans. They utilized the decapitated head of the Gorgon Medusa, an image borrowed from ancient Greek mythology, as a warding or cautionary sign. Upon their arrival in Celtic territories, the Roman legions discovered an established head cult: as the Gorgon appeared to be a familiar symbol, it was incorporated into a few Romano-Celtic places of worship - most notably Sul's temple at the renowned thermal springs, known as Aquae SulIS in southwestern Britain. Although Medusa was a goddess, the sacred heads revered by the Celts were usually male; henceforth, the "male Gorgon" located in the temple of Sulis represents a distinct combination of Greek, Roman, and Celtic interpretations in a single depiction.
