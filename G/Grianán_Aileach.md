Grianán Aileach, also known as Greenan Elly, Aileach, Oileach, Ailech Néit, and Aleach Ned, is a site of Irish mythology located in Co. Donegal. The site is an impressive and vast Hillfort, with triple walls made of stone, which is named after Aileach - a woman or goddess believed to be buried under the structure. However, the name Aileach has also been identified as the name of the land or the tribe responsible for building it. Despite the structure's significance, the name is puzzling rather than elucidating. While some suggest that it was named after Grian, the Sun goddess, the name "grianán" only derives from the word "sun". Aileach is referred to as the capital of the Province of Ulster in early texts, making it as important as Tara and Cruachan. Legend has it that Grianán Aileach was built by the Tuatha Dé Danann, the mythological tribe of the goddess Danu, and held against the Milesian invaders. Nuada of the Silver Arm, their king, is believed to be buried underneath the walls. Grianán Aileach was also the home of Dagda, a benevolent god who buried his son Áed Minbhrec there. The Ui Néill dynasty, descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages, held it until the 13th century, making it one of the last forts to be kept by the historical rulers descended from the Celts.
