At Carrigogunnel ("rock of the candle"), in Co. Limerick, a light shone every night, taking the life of anyone who looked at it. Grana is the name given to the Witch or Fairy who lit the destructive candle. Grana may be a lesser form of the goddesses Gráinne or Grian, who are related to that region. Regan, one of the courageous Fianna, put on a cap of invisibility, found Grana, and extinguished her candle to defeat her.
