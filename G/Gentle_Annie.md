A Scottish legendary character, Gentle Annie (also called Gentle Annis), was a supernatural figure with blue-black skin. She acted as a weather spirit who brought harsh winds over Cromarthy Firth in Scotland. Her name, though flattering and appeasing, has been linked to the name of an ancient goddess Anu. Her characteristics and nature are similar to that of the Cailleach.
