A deity by the name of Gebrinius is said to be a Continental Celtic entity. The Romans associated this god with their own warrior deity Mars. Gebrinius is mentioned in numerous inscriptions found in areas occupied by Celts and Germans, and as a result, it is not clear which of these cultures was responsible for his origination.
