A Welsh princess or goddess called Goleuddydd is the subject of a legend. Her name, which means 'bright day', is thought to be a cover for an ancient Fertility goddess of Celtic or previous-Celtic origin. She married a prince named Cilydd but was unable to have a baby by him, which worried and distressed her people, who wanted an heir to the throne and believed in the significance of a childless royal couple. Eventually, Goleuddydd conceived, but she went insane and refused to live indoors, spending her time in the wild instead (similar to the Irish myth of Mess Buachalla). When she went into labor, she went to a pig farmer's sty and gave birth to her son there, who was called Kulhwch or "pig." Like Rhiannon, the Welsh Horse-goddess who bore a colt, the story reflects an ancient Pig goddess of fertility in hiding.
