A prominent figure in Irish folklore is Geodruisge. Belonging to Co. Mayo, he was a gigantic being with a palace located on Downpatrick Head, known as Dún Geodruisge by the locals. This colossal creature committed the act of stealing cattle owned by a mighty witch, resulting in her putting a curse on him. As a result, his palace detached from the mainland, causing Geodruisge to be swept away to sea.
