An Arthurian hero named Guyomard who was the lover of King Arthur's half-sister, the sorceress Morgan, was known for his untrustworthiness. Morgan was angered by Guyomard's behavior and cursed a valley located in the magical forest of Brocéliande. Morgan's curse meant that any knight who was unfaithful to his mistress and wandered into the Perilous Valley would be trapped there forever and surrounded by imagined demons and insurmountable obstacles. Lancelot, who remained ever true to his beloved Guinevere, eventually succeeded in breaking the enchantment.
