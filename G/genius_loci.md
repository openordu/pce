Genii locorum (singular: genius loci) are deities in Continental Celtic and British culture who are associated with special natural places such as mountains, wells, and waterfalls. The name is derived from the Latin phrase that means “spirit of the place.” The Celts believed that Nature was divine, and each god or goddess was linked to a particular location; therefore, Celtic deities are rarely found repeated in the Celtic world. Mountains and rivers were often viewed as goddesses, while ancient trees and certain watercourses were considered gods. These deities had various functions, including overseeing fertility, prosperity, and death in their respective regions. The arrival of the Romans led to the names of the invading gods being applied to the native ones, or the unnamed native deities were assimilated into the Roman gods (see Interpretatio Romana). As a result, Apollo, Minerva, and Mercury were substituted for numerous specific Celtic nature gods and goddesses. Many specific names of place-deities have been lost, as the altars built for unnamed deities of the place were simply labeled “genius loci.” These altars typically depicted symbols of abundance and fertility, such as the Cornucopia, turret crown, and the Patera or offering plate.
