Goddess Gwyar, also known as Anna, was worshipped in Wales. Although the tale of this Welsh deity, who was wedded to the god of the sky, is incompletely preserved, her name, meaning "gore," is still known. According to legend, Gwyar was king Arthur's sibling, although sometimes his sister was identified as Morgause or Morgan. It is also said that Gwyar had a pair of sons, one of whom was virtuous, while the other was wicked.
