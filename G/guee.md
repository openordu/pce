A Manx prayer and curse were part of the traditional practice on the Isle of Man, and both were performed while kneeling. The act of cursing was termed as “wishing upon the knees.” One of the potent curses was the Skeab Lome, meaning “naked broom,” where a broom was summoned for its ability to clear away wickedness or eliminate adversaries.
