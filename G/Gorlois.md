Gorlois was an Arthurian hero, wedded to Igraine, one of the most beautiful women in Wales, and mother to several daughters including the magical Morgan and the doomed Morgause. While she was content with her husband, Igraine caught the eye of the valiant Uther Pendragon who desired her. In spite of her loyalty to her spouse, Uther plotted with the magician Merlin to materialize in the form of Gorlois and lay with Igraine. Unbeknownst to her, Gorlois had already died by the hand of Uther when she conceived Arthur, the once and future king of Britain.
