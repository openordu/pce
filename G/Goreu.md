Goreu (Goreu fab Custennin) was a heroic Welsh figure. Despite being a relatively unknown character, Goreu played a crucial role in the tale of Kuhlwch And Olwen. As a child, he was hidden away due to the fact that Yspaddaden Penkawr, Olwen's father and a giant, had consumed his 22 older siblings. With the help of King Arthur, Goreu was freed and eventually became a member of the Camelot court. He ultimately defeated the giant who had killed his family.
