Golwg, also known as Golwg Haffddydd, was a Welsh heroine featured in early Arthurian legends. She was the maidservant to Esyllt, who eventually became the lover of a friend of Trystan's. As the story further progresses and becomes that of Tristan and Iseult, the maid's name is altered to Brangien.
