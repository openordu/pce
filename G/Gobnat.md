Gobnat, also known as Gobnait, Cobnat, Abby, and Abigail, is a prominent figure in Irish mythology and is considered a heroine, a saint, or a goddess. Located in Ballyvourney, Co. Cork, there is a Christian shrine that showcases a Sheela Na Gig, an image linked to ancient Mother Goddesses. The shrine is believed to be under the patronage of St. Gobnait, who serves as the patroness of Bees. This raises the possibility that she was originally an ancient goddess of the area who was Christianized. According to folklore, bees acted as Gobnait's protectors by warning her of any approaching danger. Gobnait is said to have had two sisters, one of whom is the mythical Crobh Dearg (or Lasair), while the other is Latiaran. Gobnait is particularly celebrated in early February, marking the beginning of spring in Ireland and the Celtic feast of Imbolc. These observances suggest that Gobnait may have been the first of a triad of seasonal goddesses, as her sisters are also connected to specific dates on the ancient calendar. A renowned shrine dedicated to her is located at Kilgobnet (church of Gobnat) in Co. Kerry.
