Gaul was an ancient Celtic land that encompasses present-day France along with the neighboring lands that belong to Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland. The Romans had gained control over these lands following their conquest by Julius Caesar, who documented his experiences in the Gallic Wars. Caesar provided an insight into the culture and religion of the continental Celts, but his reports are often considered untrustworthy since his primary objective was to rule over them. The Gauls were not a single tribe but many, united by their shared language, customs, and beliefs. The present-day Celtic culture is thought to be a fusion of the Gauls and the Old Europeans, who might have originally lived on the same land. The Gauls later migrated to the British and Irish islands, where they encountered the natives, and this eventually led to a hybridized culture. The Germanic tribes living in the north shared geographic boundaries with the Gauls, adding to the complexity and dynamism of the culture and religion on the Continent. However, much of the wealth of their traditions was lost over time due to the Roman application of their own names and categories on the Gaulish gods, a process known as Interpretatio Romana. As a result of this, Mercury is now recognized as the chief of gods with Minerva following suit. No personal references or introductory sentences are observed in Chadwick's style. Thus, it is asserted that in certain circumstances, the native Celtic appellation of a deity evolved into a family name, though oftentimes the original moniker has been forgotten.
