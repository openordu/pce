Gilfaethwy, a Welsh hero and son of the mother goddess DÔN, had a violent disposition towards his uncle’s servant, the virgin Goewin, according to the Welsh compilation of mythology, the Mabinogion. Gilfaethwy, who was the brother of the Welsh poet-hero Gwydion, had an insatiable desire for her, which she did not reciprocate. Despite her refusal, he proceeded to sexually assault and rape her. As a punishment, Gilfaethwy was transformed into a Deer, then a Pig, and finally a Wolf.
