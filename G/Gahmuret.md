An Arthurian hero named Gahmuret has an intriguing story. As mentioned in one text, he eventually became the father of the chivalrous Percival. Prior to this, he had joined the army of Baghdad's Caliph and showed great bravery by rescuing the besieged queen, Belkane of Zazamanc, single-handedly from two armies. He won Belkane's heart and they got married, eventually having a son named Feirefiz. Gahmuret, however, couldn't ignore the allure of adventure and returned to Wales, where he met Herzeloyde. He ended up pursuing her through battle and she became the mother of the noble Percival.
