A small valley nestled in the Grampion mountains of Tayside near Fortingall hosts a peculiar tradition that dates back to ancient times, possibly to the Celtic age. Glen Lyon is an alluring Scottish site that celebrates the beginning of summer on May 1, at Beltane. The area boasts several place-names that honor the Cailleach or Hag, an ancient goddess from prehistoric times. For instance, Glen Cailliche, Allt Cailliche, and Tigh nam Cailliche, which refers to a pile of water-polished rocks of nearly human shape known as the Hag’s House. The rocks comprise the Cailleach, a stone that stands over a foot in height, along with two smaller boulders referred to as the Bodach or old man and Nighean, the daughter. Little undefined rocks surround them that represent the hag’s infants. The stones receive a thorough cleansing and are restored to their original position every Beltane by a nearby resident, while every Samhain, the hag and her family are securely put away inside a small stone enclosure. The correlation between the ritual appearance and disappearance of the stone family and the Celtic celebrations suggests a possible Celtic heritage, although the hag goddess herself is believed to go even further back into prehistory, symbolizing a cosmic goddess of the pre-Celtic people. As per local legends, Fionn Mac Cumhaill, an Irish hero, took up residence in the area.
