A British goddess known as the Grimes Grave Goddess has been discovered in a prehistoric area of Norfolk, England, near the Grimes Graves flint mines, which were operational around 4000 B.C.E. Historians are not certain about the cultural origin of the tiny figure, primarily due to the difficulty in dating the rock. The figure is crafted from chalk and shaped somewhat crudely, with a pregnant-looking, smirking expression. The resemblance of the figure to the Sheela Na Gig, another goddess figure with a great deal of controversy surrounding its identification, has not gone unnoticed. The surrounding offerings found alongside the Grimes Goddess, including a chalk phallus, a chalk lamp, flint blocks and antlers, suggest that the figure was deliberately placed in the mine. Her original name is unknown, and her true significance remains a mystery, yet to be determined.
