The Tuatha Dé Danann, Ireland’s magical race, possessed four treasures: an inexhaustible Cauldron, the Lia Fáil – an Inauguration Stone that stood on the royal hill of Tara, the sword of the warrior king Nuada that unfailingly located its prey, and the Gáe Assail - an Irish mythic symbol of a spear that returned to the thrower's hand once it had completed its bloodletting. The spear was capable of killing the victim with certainty if the thrower shouted out the word for “yew” (ibar) while launching it.
