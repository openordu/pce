A Welsh folkloric figure, the gwyllion, is said to haunt isolated roads in Wales. This ancient hag is depicted as a strange female spirit carrying a wooden milkpail, wearing ash-colored rags and an oblong four-cornered hat, with an apron thrown over her shoulder. Despite not having any records of her attacking individuals on the roads, her apparition was enough to frighten lone travelers. As a member of the Fairy races, she held a fear of metals, particularly Iron, and would immediately vanish if presented with a knife or similar piece of cutlery.
