Cornish folklore has a prominent figure known as Gog (also referred to as Gogmagog or Gigmagog). In Geoffrey of Monmouth's account, Gog is a Cornish Giant who attacked the British king Brutus during his Inauguration ceremonies. However, this narrative has it that Gog was vanquished by warrior Corineus. With time, the legendary figure split into two menacing personas; Gog and Magog, who are said to have attacked Londinium (London) during the reign of king Vortigen.
