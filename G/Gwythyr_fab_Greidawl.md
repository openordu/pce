A Welsh figure from folklore known as Gwythyr fab Greidawl was one of two suitors for Creiddylad, a maiden of springtime, during Welsh ceremonies that marked the Beltane season. Gwythyr represented the summer and was always victorious in these ceremonies, triumphing over the winter king, Gwynn Ap Nudd.
