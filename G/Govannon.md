Welsh god Govannon, also known as Gofannon or Gafannon, holds the title of the Welsh Smith god, who parallels his Irish counterpart Goibniu. This significant god is linked to the magician king Math, and his smithcraft was considered almost magical in early times, as metal refining was still a rare and new practice. Apart from being a great artificer, Govannon also possessed agricultural powers. He would clean the plows at the end of planting to ensure that the tools of abundance would serve another year. Govannon turns up in the Mabinogion, a collection of myths, named as the inadvertent killer of the goddess Arianrhodâ€™s son, Dylan. Dylan, who was mourned by the waves of the sea, was a magical being. In folklore, Govannon was identified as Goban Saor and portrayed as the builder of early churches. In addition to being the god of craftsmanship, Govannon also held the power over the elements and weather. For some, he resembled the ancient divinity of thunder, Taranis.
