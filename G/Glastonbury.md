A site of great mythical and legendary associations, Glastonbury is located in the southwestern part of England and is considered by some to be the site of Avalon, the Otherworld island. It houses the famous Chalice Well, known as the Blood Spring due to its iron-red waters, and the ruins of several significant Christian sites, including Glastonbury Abbey, where it is said that king Arthur and queen Guinevere are buried. According to the legend of Joseph Of Arimathea, the first Christian church in Britain was built in Glastonbury. The Tor, a pyramidal hill situated below these Christian sites, is believed to be the entryway to Annwn, the Welsh Otherworld, ruled by fairy king Gwynn Ap Nudd. It is interesting to note that there is evidence of Iron Age settlement on the Tor, which is possibly of Celtic origin, pointing to the Celtic roots of Gwynn Ap Nudd's character in folklore. Even though the original monuments and myths have been lost, the site at Glastonbury remains connected to the sacred through legend.
