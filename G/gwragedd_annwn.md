Welsh mythology tells of the Gwragedd Annwn, a type of fairy often associated with lakes. In contrast to other fairy women who would lead humans into their world only to use and abandon them, the Gwragedd Annwn were known for their desire to settle down and make dependable wives for human husbands. It was strictly forbidden, however, to ever harm one of these lake maidens, even in jest. Such an action would result in the fairy wife leaving her human family and taking all her valuable possessions, disappearing into the nearest body of water forever.
