Breton folklore is rich with legends of the Gallizenae, Druid women who resided on the Isle de Sein near Pointe de Raz off the west coast of Brittany. The location is often associated with the story of Princess Dahut and her city of Ys, known for its immoral ways. The Gallizenae were believed to be a group of priestesses, similar to the Irish Brigit, who practiced divination and other types of magic. It was said that they did not engage in any social or physical interaction with men.
