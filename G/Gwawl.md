Welsh hero Gwawl is a figure in the Welsh Mabinogion. He competed against Pwyll, the heroic king, for the goddess/queen Rhiannon's hand. By using deception, Gwawl managed to force Pwyll to withdraw his proposal, but Pwyll got even by tricking Gwawl into entering a bag, which he utilized as a football with his troops.
