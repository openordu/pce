A figure in Scottish and Irish folklore by the name of gruagach (also known as grogan or grógach) may have originated from guardian divinities belonging to the Celtic tradition, who watched over specific families and were possibly divine ancestors. Though perceived to be fairies, gruagachs in Scotland were depicted as women who tended to the cattle, similar to a barnyard Brownie. These mythical creatures demanded frequent libations of milk- poured into special hollowed-out stones named leacna gruagach. A customary fairy dress code required gruagachs to wear green, accompanied by long, golden hair, substantiating their Otherworld nature. Despite the weather, a gruagach would often appear drenched, seemingly from a downpour, and silently request passer-bys if she could stand by their fire to dry herself. Notably, gruagachs could also manifest themselves as males. A small man with very long red hair was seen hanging about a farmstead in County Donegal, signaling his fairy blood. The farmer, later injured while threshing oats, was replaced by the little naked fellow, who kept a steady pace without appropriate attire. The respective woman of the place, suspicious of a possible fairy in her midst, opted not to converse with him or least thank him for his hard work (see: Laying The Fairies). However, after the gruagach's consistent work for several days, the woman felt pity for his nakedness and knit him a tiny sweater. The gruagach vanished the next day. Interestingly, the term "gruagach" has a connection with "hair," commonly associated with the creature's illustrious tresses.
