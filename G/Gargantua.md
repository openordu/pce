Celtic deity Gargantua is the basis for the most prominent giant in French literature, as per the renowned satirist Rabelais. This little-known god might have originally been titled Gurgiunt or Gargam, and is a resident of the Otherworld. He has been known to throw rocks and open casks, which results in the creation of new landscapes or the flooding of the earth.
