A creature known as the goayr heddagh haunts the Isle of Man. This being is either a fairy or ghost that has the appearance of a goat. Goban Saor, also known as Gobhan Saor or Gubawn Seer, is a folklore figure from British and Irish traditions. In regions of Britain and Ireland where the Vikings lived, one can find remnants of the divine Smith, Wayland, present in the character of Goban Saor. He is an amoral figure who, in one tale, put an elderly woman into his furnace so that he could transform her into a young maiden. Goban Saor is also said to have served as the architect for many significant churches. It can be challenging to extricate the various cultural influences present in tales of Goban Saor, who, like the Celtic smith god Goibniu, is sometimes depicted as possessing the Glas Ghaibhleann, the cow of abundance.
