The infant king of Ireland, Gwern, was born to Branwen, a Welsh princess, and her Irish husband, king Matholwch. Sadly, his life was cut short when his uncle Efnisien, without provocation, destroyed Matholwch’s horses, leading to Branwen's imprisonment in Ireland. Gwern was named king of the land in his infancy by his mother. However, at the tender age of three, Efnisien burnt Gwern alive, resulting in a great battle that claimed the lives of most Welsh heroes and all warrior of Ireland.
