A woman by the name of Gaine is regarded as an Irish heroine despite her obscurity in the place-poems of ancient Ireland known as the Dindshenchas. Gaine is described as being "learned and a seer and a chief Druid," of whom it is unclear how she prophesied and composed her knowledge as she never uttered a single word. Nevertheless, it was Gaine who named the central hill of Ireland as Uisneach which stands for "over somewhat." Her decision was based on her student, the powerful druid Mide, who had cut off the tongues of Ireland's other druids, buried them on the hillside, and sat over them.
