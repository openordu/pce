A Scottish and Welsh Fairy figure, glastig (also known as glaistig, glaistic, glaisein, glaishrig) was a gray, thin woman with long yellow hair that reached the ground behind her. Sometimes, she appeared as a Giant. Glastig belonged to the Fairy race and sported the typical green color associated with it; hence, some called her the green glastig. She was rarely seen with others of her kind, but occasionally, a pair would grace the pastures. Glastig preferred farms with cows, where she would loiter. She also lingered around happy-go-lucky folk with lower intellect, whom she loved and cared for. Her boisterous voice was preternaturally loud and could be heard for miles. Being a spirit of the Milk cattle, she demanded the first milk taken each morning as an offering. Failure to do so resulted in her drying up the milk or penalizing the stingy dairyman. Nonetheless, if given regular libations of milk, placed in a pitcher or bowl on the doorstep, the glastig would stay for quite some time. Acting as a householding spirit akin to the Brownie, she worked hard to make sure everything was spotless, especially when company was on the way. Thus, waking up to a sparkling clean house was an instant sign that visitors were expected. Just like other laboring spirits, it was critical never to mention the glastig, and complimenting her labor was even worse; this forced her to abscond to another farm. Similar to the glastig, in the Isle of Man, the fenodyree, who lived in the mountains, crept down to the farmlands and tended to the fields and helped with the household chores secretly. As with other fantastical beings, she would decline any form of reward or recompense for the tasks done and would vanish if such were proffered.
