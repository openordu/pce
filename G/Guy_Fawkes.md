British folklore has a tale about Guy Fawkes. The story goes that in 1605, Roman Catholics attempted to destroy the English Houses of Parliament with Guy Fawkes at the helm, but the plot failed. This led to an annual festival commemorating the execution of the conspirators. It is said that the date of the festival, November 5, falls remarkably close to Samhain, the ancient Celtic feast of the beginning of winter that takes place on November 1. Interestingly, the festival includes bonfires, which could have replaced the traditional Samhain fires.
