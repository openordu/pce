A significant archaeological artifact, the Gundestrup Cauldron, was discovered in a Danish peat bog in 1891. It is believed to have been ritually deposited or hidden during a crisis. The basin features bas-reliefs across its surface, which depict puzzling scenes resembling rituals and figures resembling divine entities. Dating from the 2nd or 1st century B.C.E., there are disputes regarding whether the basin represents Germanic or Celtic culture, despite the questionable historical significance of the site where the treasure was recovered. Nevertheless, the majority of experts maintain that the cauldron was either crafted by Celts or influenced by Celtic beliefs. Notable figures on the vessel include a goddess being carried on a cart and a horned god resembling the one known elsewhere as Cernunnos.
