Aed, also known as Aodh mac Fidga, was an Irish hero famously known as Goll mac Morna. As a one-eyed warrior, he was always at odds with the great Irish hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Originally named Aed (“bright”), he was the son of Morna, hence his surname, "mac Morna." Some stories suggest that his father was a Giant from the Fir Bolg people, who were associated with the province of Connacht, which was also Goll’s domain. During a fight with Luchet, Aed lost an eye and became known as Goll (“the one-eyed”). Alternatively, legend has it that Goll killed and beheaded Cumhall, Fionn’s father, thereby starting a longstanding feud between Goll’s family, the Clan Morna, and Fionn’s, the Clan Baíscne. However, Goll was not always Fionn’s enemy, as he rescued him from the clutches of three powerful Hags who held him captive in the cave of Keshcorran. In return, Fionn gave Goll his daughter’s hand in marriage. Additionally, Fionn also slept beside Goll on finding him sleeping by the Shannon River, letting the weary warrior rest. As such, many people view Fionn and Goll as part of a mythological cycle, where each depended on and opposed the other. Nonetheless, animosity ultimately took over, and after he was released from Keshcorran, Fionn killed Goll’s grandson Fer Í, which reignited the feud. Driven to the edge of Ireland, Goll survived without food or water for 30 days before Mac Smaile, a minor member of the Fianna, killed him during his moment of despair and hunger. The feud between Goll and the Fianna did not end with his death; in fact, it continued until the Fianna's defeat at the battle of Gabhair. According to legends, after his demise, Goll supposedly found a new home in one of the mystical islands in the western sea, where he had met his ill fate. Besides, Goll stars in the legend of Lugh, a hero who was half-Fomorian and half-Tuatha Dé Danann, best known for killing his evil grandfather Balor. In one variation, Lugh was slain by Goll, while in another, Lugh vanquished Goll after the great second battle of Mag Tuired. Goll's character can easily be mistaken with the Fomorian king Balor, who could kill a person merely by looking at them with his one evil eye. Finally, in a minor tale, Goll was killed by the young warrior Laoghaire mac Crimthann, who also won the heart of his beloved DéR Gréine as a result of his successful combat against the gigantic Goll. It is quite possible that Goll mac Morna is either connected with or identical to another one-eyed character, the Salmon that swam in the pool near the well-known Assaroe waterfall, sometimes referred to as Fintan, who also bore the name Goll Essa Ruaid. This association further links Goll to Fionn. It was the salmon from Assaroe that, when mistakenly cooked and consumed by Fionn (see Finnéces), granted Fionn his supernatural perception and sagacity. Finally, Goll mac Morna has been tied to another one-eyed champion, Goll mac Carbada, slain by the Ulster champion Cúchulainn in a battle reminiscent of Fionn's combat with Goll.
