British mythological site Gorm (Gorm the Grim) has a giant's representation named after it carved into the gorge of River Avon. Scholars suggest that Gorm likely originated from a nearby deity who was transformed grotesquely due to the influence of Christian priests on Celtic (and maybe Viking) religion. The carving is believed to portray a cannibal and there are remnants indicating the existence of a character bearing the same name in Orkney.
