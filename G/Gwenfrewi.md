A Welsh heroine known as Gwenfrewi (Winefride) existed in the quasi-historical period of the 7th-century. The local prince assaulted her and attempted to violate her virtue, but she managed to escape his advances. As punishment for her self-control, the prince decapitated Gwenfrewi with his sword as she rolled down a hill. Her Head rested in a little valley where a Well for healing immediately burst forth. Bueno, Gwenfrewiâ€™s uncle and a minor Saint, placed her head back on her shoulders. Instantly, her head knit together leaving only a small, thin scar across her throat as evidence of the crime.
