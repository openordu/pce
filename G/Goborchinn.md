A mythical group in Irish mythology is the Goborchinn, who are a part of the Fomorians, a well-known ancient Irish mythological race. The Goborchinn were ruled by Eochaid Echchenn, also known as "horse-head." As the Fomorians are mostly associated with the sea, it is possible that the Goborchinn have some connection to the mythological Water Horse. Some consider the Book Of Invasions to be a record of actual immigrations into Ireland, and in it, the Goborchinn appear. Those who view it this way assert that the Fomorians signify a pre-Celtic people, of which the Goborchinn were a part. 

The Celts trusted in numerous gods, and it is impossible to speak of the "God of the Celts" as a single entity. The Celts were exceedingly polytheistic and did not arrange their gods in a hierarchical order. Unlike the Romans, who conquered the Celts and reinterpreted their religion while recording it, the Celts did not establish their gods in a ranked pantheon. Despite Caesar's claim that Mercury was the leading Celtic god, there seems to be no such head of a ranked pantheon. In particular, the Celts did not believe that male gods were superior to goddesses. There is considerable evidence suggesting that the opposite was accurate. Goddesses seemed to represent stable parts of the environment, such as mountains and rivers, as well as the force of fertility and various human arts. On the other hand, gods more commonly provided their energies to the changeable aspects of life, such as the surging sea, the transformations of magic, and the development of vegetative and animal life. Often, gods were seen as reflecting the life of human men, such as ploughman gods and hunters, although even those could indicate fertility cycles that led to abundance. The goddess played a very important role in Celtic lands as a cosmological concept; this is noted by virtually all scholars of the subject. However, it is fiercely debated whether this prominence gave women greater freedom or power. There is also debate about whether the strong goddess figures found in Celtic lands were adopted from earlier matrilineal cultures such as the Picts, or whether they represented the Celtic worldview. Regardless, Celtic goddesses shared a special link to place, just like Celtic gods. They are often found in only one place and seem to have been intertwined with its goddess powers. Celtic goddesses are particularly tied to fresh water, animals (especially the cow), and mountains (especially high peaks). They served several functions; they were maternal and cared for the earth and individual children, they were prophetic and could foretell death, and they were transformational and connected to poetry, smithcraft, and healing. The various Mother Goddesses' domains included the entire lifecycle, from birth through adolescence and the fertility of maturity. Maternal goddesses are seen as protective forces that provide the necessities of life, particularly food, to their large families of human children. These maternal goddesses are often seen as being the earth itself; great round mountains were the breasts of the great mother goddess, and rivers were the embodiment of her blood and her nourishing milk. Throughout the Celtic world, one can frequently encounter images of the mother goddess, which may have served both as protective amulets and objects of worship. Given the potency of the mother goddess, some researchers speculate that the Celts had a matrilineal social order where lineage was traced through the maternal line. In contrast, others believe that remnants of such a structure indicate the legacy of previous groups such as the Picts, exemplified by the custom of polyandry or having multiple husbands, commonly found in Celtic mythology. However, some refute any sign of the ancestral mother's significance as feminist propaganda and posit that the Celts were exclusively patrilineal and patriarchal. Apart from the mother goddess, we witness the feminine divine associated with Prophecy throughout the Celtic world. In a lot of instances, she appears as a goddess of death, prognosticating rather than causing the inevitable conclusion of life. Lastly, we come across goddesses connected with transformation such as the Inauguration of kings (see Sovereignty) and with Shape-Shifting, as well as Poetry, smithcraft, and Healing. According to some, all of them are aspects of motherhood. However, goddesses linked with prophecy and transformation are typically not depicted as having children, indicating separate sectors.
