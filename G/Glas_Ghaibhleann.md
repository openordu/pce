A mythological figure in Irish folklore and mythology is Glas Ghaibhleann (also known as Glas Ghaibhnann, Glas Gavlen, Glas Gownach, Glas Gainach, and Glas Gaunach, as well as Fuwch Leathwen Lefrith). This figure was a great cow whose milk was so abundant that it could feed multitudes. With an impressive cream content of 100%, her milk made large amounts of butter too. The strength of this cow was also legendary, being able to travel through three of Ireland's four provinces in a single day. This has led to various place names beginning with "Glas" (e.g., Glasnevin) across the land, which bear testimony to her passage. Her name has also become a common noun for spring or stream, which creates confusion with interpreting place names. The cow provided milk to anyone who needed it, filling whatever vessel they carried, even with large or small capacity. Glas may represent the Irish land itself, with references to its being a faithful brown white-backed cow. Interestingly, the cow did not need to have a calf in order to give milk, and the milk flowed unceasingly with as much as five years passing without calving. Some stories suggest that Glas was a Fairy beast belonging to the king of the Land Under Wave or the Otherworld, while other stories suggest that she was the goddess Bó Find in the form of a white cow. The cow was said to have been guarded by a smith named Gaivnin Gow, Gavidin, or simply Gavin, who purportedly lived among Co.'s rolling hills in Ireland. The owner of the Glas's halter was the smith in Cavan, and it is said that she came to him unfailingly every night. However, some legends claim that the Glas was actually the smith's enchanted sister or stepsister. In Ireland, it is common to find place-names related to the cow near locations named for the smith, and in certain renditions of the story, the Glas was owned by the smith god Goibniu. Many tales involve attempts by greedy individuals to steal the Glas for their own benefit, but the cow always managed to escape or be rescued, returning her bounty to the people. It is recounted in a particular story that a man had locked the Glas up in Glen Columkille in Co. Donegal, but the creature flew out of the glen, over the high ridges around it, and disappeared into the sky. According to legend, there hasn't been free milk in Ireland since that time. Another narrative asserts that a wicked woman tried to milk the Glas into a sieve, causing the cow to flee the earth in anger. In yet another story, set in the rocky region known as the Burren, somebody attempted to milk the Glas into an abyss called Poll na Leamhnachta, or "hole of sweet milk." Sadly, even the Glas's vast milk supply was unable to fill the boundless cavity, leaving the cow depleted, so she fled the area and was never seen there again. In Britain, Scotland, and Wales, the Glas is known as the Dun Cow and is similarly renowned for her immense abundance. Just like in Ireland, greed eventually caused the Dun Cow's downfall - a Witch attempted to milk her into a mesh, ultimately killing the miraculous creature. In Kirkham, Lancashire, a whalebone was long thought to have originated from one of the Dun Cow's bones. The inhabitants of Towry, Wales, were eyeing a cow named Fuwch Leathwen Lefrith, who roamed the country distributing her milk quite generously until she reached their valley. They intended to turn her into a steak and kidney pie, but the cow vanished just in time, taking all her bountifulness with her. Scholars have linked this magical cow to the mythologies of India, where cloud cows descended to earth raining milk, and were stolen by Vritra the demon, wishing to unleash drought and famine upon earth, according to Rig Veda. This link of cow with milk and water also appears in the persona of the River and Cow Goddess Bóand, after whom River Boyne in Ireland is named. The cow's sinuous path across the land, never covering less than six miles a day, also strengthened the connection between cow and river. The Glas also played an essential role in Lugh's fantastical conception, grandchild and murderer of the monstrous Fomorian ruler, Balor of the Evil Eye. The latter established his primacy from a terrifying stronghold on Tory Island, after the Fir Bolg, Irish legends' fierce warriors, pushed him aside to the kingdom's edges. Meanwhile, on the mainland, the smith lived with his magical cow at Druin na Teine. Balor coveted the cow as it was the source of the Irish people's nourishment, but the smith kept a watchful eye on it, and only took his stare off of it when laboring in the forge. While he was hard at work, a man known as Cian or MacInally, or Fin son of Ceanfaeligh, kept the Glas under tight security. Following behind the Glas, never in front of her, he struggled to keep up with her strenuous pace as she wandered all around the island. Cian eventually grew inattentive, worn out by her fast movements, and fell asleep, giving Balor the opportunity to strike. Balor then took the Glas and boarded her onto a boat that set sail for Tory Island, stopping beforehand at Inishbofin, or Inis Bó Find, which means “island of the white cow”. Here, the Glas drank from the Well called Tober na Glaise, which is also known as the “gray cow well”. Upon their arrival at Tory Island, they landed at Port na Glaise, which translates to “gray cow port”. Because the smith was absolutely furious when he realized that his mystical cow was missing, he threatened Cian with death if she did not return her within three days. Cian then went to Balor’s realm to try and earn back the cow but, while he was there, he came across Eithne, Balor’s beautiful daughter. Eithne was trapped in a high tower because Balor had feared the prophecy that her son would kill him. To ensure his own immortality, Balor had reasoned that if Eithne never saw a man, she could never bear a child. Disguised as a woman, Cian sneaked into Eithne’s accommodations and seduced her; as a result, she gave birth to Lugh, who later killed Balor in a battle which fulfilled the prophecy. Though Cian ultimately managed to return the cow to the smith, he was killed by Balor himself for seducing Eithne. In many myths and legends, the cow of abundance is frequently associated with various figures, such as Brigit, who is regarded as Ireland’s St.<TOPIC> A cow owned by Brigit was reputed to be a prolific milk-producer that filled the butter stores of the abbey. This link between Glas and Brigit reaches as far as Britain: a carving of the saint as a milkmaid can be spotted in Glastonbury.
