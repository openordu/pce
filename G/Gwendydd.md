Welsh heroine Gwendydd, also known as Gwendolyn, Gwendolena, Gwenddydd, Gwyneth, Ganieda and Venotia, was the sister of the famed magician Merlin. It is unclear whether she was his twin, lover or both. After being ensnared by the seductive Viviane in a magical forest, Merlin transferred his powers and knowledge to Gwendydd. Some stories depict her as Merlin's wife, but after his descent into madness, she wed the benevolent King Rhydderch Hael.
