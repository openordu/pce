British folkloric figures are the Green Ladies, akin to the Dames Vertes of France. These fairy maidens are believed to linger around freshwater, such as wells, lakes, and pools in Britain. Although occasionally mischievous and alluring individuals to their demise similar to mermaids, they can also be merry and amiable creatures.
