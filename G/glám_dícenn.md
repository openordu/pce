In ancient Ireland, a specific posture known as the glám dícenn was adopted by Bards or Druids in order to cast a powerful Curse. This ritual posture involved standing on one leg, holding out one arm, and closing one eye. By assuming this position, the verbal curse became much more intense, making it impossible to avoid its power. The Hag who destroyed King Conaire in the story of Da Derga’s hostel also took on the glám dícenn before cursing him for breaking his sacred vows (refer to Geis).
