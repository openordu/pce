A British folkloric figure, the goblin (hobgoblin) is a general term for Fairies who are considered evil. Goblins are known to be mischievous and irritating, and can also be dangerous. They come in various forms such as the Vough, the Pooka, the Bogie, and the Water Horse; all of which have roots in the Celtic concept of the Otherworld. Gnomes belong to the medieval alchemy lore and are distinct from goblins. In her long poem "Goblin Market," English poet Christina Rossetti drew from traditional fairylore, linking leering and wicked goblins with the theme of Fairy Kidnapping to create a haunting vision of emotional distress.
