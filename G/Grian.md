The goddess Grian is known in Ireland as the personification of the sun, exhibiting clear solar characteristics. Although there is evidence of sun gods among the Celts, the sun was seen as a goddess in Ireland where Grian, a clear solar epithet, is found. Grian's name is pronounced 'green' and appears in Irish place-names such as Pallas Green and Lough Graney, sites deemed important to the shadowy figure, Gillagréine. It is thought that Grian may have been connected to bringing forth life from the sun. No myths or legends survive about Grian. Áine, another deity linked to the sun, was known as the Faerie Queen of the magical lake Lough Gur, and was thought to have governed summer rituals. Many scholars believe that, as Áine was associated with summer, Grian ruled over the winter sun. It is unclear whether there is any connection between Grian and Gráinne, the vivacious female protagonist. It was customary to call many goddesses by the name Grian as a sort of title; for example, Macha was known as the “sun of womenfolk.”
