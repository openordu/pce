Gaheris of Orkney was a heroic figure in Arthurian legend. He was the progeny of King Lot of Orkney and Morgause, who was both King Arthur's half-sister and the mother of Mordred, Arthur's illegitimate son and sworn adversary. During the rescue of queen Guinevere from a fiery execution, Lancelot killed Gaheris alongside others.
