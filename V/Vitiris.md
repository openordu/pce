British god Vitiris (Vitris, Venus, Hvitiris) has gained popularity through numerous inscriptions found in northern England, which indicate that he had followers from outside the Celtic community as well. Despite this, very little information is available regarding what he symbolized, although depictions of him alongside a Pig or a Serpent have been discovered.
