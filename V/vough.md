The Scottish Highlands have long been home to many terrifying folkloric figures, one of which is the vough (also known as fuath or brollachan). This eerie figure, which takes on the form of a female Bogie or Kelpie, is said to be the most feared apparition to haunt the region. Although she can be captured, she cannot be restrained. One account tells of a successful hunt, only for the capturing party to find the creature dissolved into a blob of jellyfish. The vough, whose name means "hatred" or "aversion," is typically met with discomfort and unease. Despite usually appearing in a female form, this supernatural being has also been known to appear as a male. Their webbed feet and noseless faces, dressed often in the color green, are further distinguishing features. Even though they prefer the night, they are known to communicate with humans both sexually and conversationally, even passing on their aversion through bloodlines, such as with the Munroes. It is worth noting that the term brollachan is thought to refer to the vough in its immature or larval state.
