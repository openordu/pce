The literary text known as Imram, plural Imrama, is an Irish mythological category. It is one of several groups, including Aisling, Destruction and Wooing, from which we derive our understanding of Irish mythology. Imrama describes the heroic travels to the Otherworld and the events that occur there. Certain Imrama texts incorporate elements of the aisling (dream-poem) and Satire. For instance, the Voyage of Bran tells the story of a man enticed by a Fairy Lover to abandon his homeland. Another famous Imrama, the Voyage of Maelduin, depicts the protagonist encountering various terrifying women from the Otherworld while at sea. Additionally, the Adventure, another distinct yet comparable form, depicts journeys to the Otherworld but focuses primarily on the destination rather than the journey itself.
