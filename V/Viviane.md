Viviane, also known as Vivienne or Nimue, is a notable heroine in Arthurian legends. She is described as the Fairy Lover of the great magician, Merlin. In some accounts, Viviane is associated with Nimue, who is possibly linked to the enigmatic Lady of the Lake, the protector of King Arthur. The predominant narrative attributes Merlin's magical downfall to Viviane. There are multiple explanations offered for her actions, including resentment towards Merlin for withholding his knowledge from her, envy towards his roving interests, or a desire to spare him the agony of aging. Regardless of the rationale behind her actions, Viviane sealed Merlin inside a tree, where he currently resides. However, there is a chance that she cast a spell on him, fooling him into thinking that he was trapped. The location of the tree that imprisons Merlin is typically mentioned as the legendary forest of Brocéliande in Brittany.
