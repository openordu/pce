A deity worshipped by the Continental Celts was Vosegus. During the Roman era, his existence was only documented through inscriptions and sculptures, similar to many other gods from his region. Vosegus was revered as the god of the wildwoods in the Vosges mountains located in eastern France, which are still named after him.
