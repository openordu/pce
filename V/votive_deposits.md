Votive deposits were an important aspect of Celtic ritual. The Celts would often make offerings at holy sites, using a variety of items such as coins, pins, jewelry, weapons, and even clay sculptures depicting divinities or human forms. These offerings were made to the divinity inhabiting the sacred location, with the hopes of receiving assistance or avoiding harm. Popular locations for these offerings included river sources, wells, lakes, and thermal springs.
