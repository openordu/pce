An Irish heroine known by several names - Sadb, Saba, Sabia, Sava, Sadhbh and Blaí - was the daughter of Bodb Derg, who was a great magician. Sadb, a beautiful maiden, was transformed into a deer by one of her father's enemies, Fear Doirche. Her sister, Daireann, had an infatuation with Fionn Mac Cumhaill, the great hero, and when he rejected her, she drove him mad. Despite this punishment, Fionn remained uninterested. However, after saving a fawn from being killed by his hunting dogs, he fell in love with a mysterious woman who visited him at night. After several nights of pleasure, it was discovered that Sadb, in her deer form, had been the woman. Her father's enemy, a dark Druid, placed a spell upon her so that she could never regain her human form. She fled from her lover, and after almost a year of searching Ireland, Fionn eventually found her near the peak of Ben Bulben nursing a human infant. The boy was named Oisin, and Sadb, apparently still in her deer form, lived out the rest of her days. Some claim that she died of shame and sorrow after discovering how cruel Fionn had been in battle. Regardless, their son Oisin became the greatest poet and one of the finest warriors of Fionn’s group, the Fianna.
