Ritual action involving spells is deeply ingrained in Celtic tradition. The power of verbal magic was historically attributed to the Bards, who were thought to have the ability to reshape the physical world through the sheer force of their words. The idea that rhyming spells possess the ability to heal, when used for blessings, or to harm, when intended for curses, was borne out of this belief. Oftentimes, the recitation of the rhyme itself held more significance than the accompanying brief ceremonies such as dipping stones in water or rubbing the body. For more information on cursing, consult the entry for Curse.
