The Celts, like most societies, practiced the concept of sacrifice - the act of giving up something to gain something else. They regularly offered goods to their gods and goddesses, particularly in times of peril. These sacrifices often entailed damaging an object in some manner before depositing it at a natural site; for example, a piece of jewelry might be crushed or a Torc bent before being thrown into a Lake or interred in a Bog. Animals were also used, with the entire animal sometimes being burned and no part used for human consumption, although some portions were reserved for a celebratory feast. It is important to note that "sacrifice" is generally reserved for living or once living items, whereas "offerings" refer to items that were never alive, such as coins or jewelry. However, in most cases, "sacrifice" refers to anything that is given to the gods and is no longer for human use. See Horse Sacrifice and Human Sacrifice for further details on the concept of sacrifice.
