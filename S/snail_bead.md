Symbolic in nature, the snail bead was a mystical object that held great power for those fortunate enough to possess it. Similar in origin to the Serpent Stone, this enigmatic Scottish Talisman was believed to have formed naturally from a collection of snails secreting a mysterious fluid and compressing into a solid mass. While obtaining these stones was a challenging task due to their rarity, the effort was deemed worthwhile as they were believed to hold potent healing properties. A simple dip of the bead into a glass of water would create a powerful elixir that could cure ailments, while wearing the bead would provide a protective shield against ill fate.
