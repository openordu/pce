Irish folklore features numerous animals, but the sheep, one of the most prominent economic resources for generations, doesn't exactly stand out in that regard. Bulls and cows, by contrast, play an omnipresent role in mythology. However, there are certain folktales that mention sheep. Meeting them early in the morning was deemed unlucky, whereas knitting in the evening, when the sheep were asleep, was considered ideal.
