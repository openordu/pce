Warrior Woman Scenmed from Ireland held the position of a heroine. She, along with her army, confronted the well-known hero of Ulster, Cúchulainn, when he seized her niece, Emer. However, Cúchulainn, who had been tutored in fighting by another woman warrior, Scáthach from Scotland, managed to overpower Scenmed's forces.
