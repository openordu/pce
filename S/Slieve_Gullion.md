A circular valley, formed by ancient volcanic activity, lies in Co. Armagh and is centered around the legendary mountain of Slieve Gullion (Sliab Cuilinn, Sliab Cuillinn). The peak was named after the Fairy king Cuilenn, who was said to have lived there. However, more prominent in regional mythology is the Cailleach, the great Hag goddess who controlled the weather and formed the landscape. Local people refer to the cairn atop the mountain, built by the pre-Celtic Megalithic Civilization, as the house of Cailleach Birrn. From this cairn, she threw a huge rock across the valley; although the boulder seemed like a pebble to her, it landed miles away in the Dorsey Ramparts, where it was honored until recent times. Although the story surrounding his resting place is not recorded, the great hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill is said to be buried within the cairn.
