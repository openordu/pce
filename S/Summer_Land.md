A British folkloric site is known as Summer Land, or the Summer Country. It is often associated with the Otherworld, a place where the weather is always pleasant and flowers and fruit flourish abundantly. Additionally, the name Summer Land appears in certain texts as a reference to the land of Meleagant, the ogre who abducted queen Guinevere and held her captive until Lancelot came to her rescue.
