Continental Celtic deity known as Smertrius (Smertrios, Smertrio). The deity's name contains the syllable "smer-", which can be found in the name of the goddess Rosmerta and is believed to mean "protection." Smertrius is a lesser-known god, and only one sculpture related to the deity has been found. The sculpture depicts Smertrius as a robust man sporting a beard and a snake's tail.
