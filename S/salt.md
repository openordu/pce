Salt was a significant commodity for the Celts, as they built much of their early wealth on it. They primarily obtained salt from the extensive salt mines located near Hallstatt in Austria, which was one of their primary centers. Salt was an essential resource for ancient inland societies who relied on it to preserve food during the winter, including ham, jerky, and salted fish. The Celts also traded salt with distant places, and it had no religious significance to the continental Celts but viewed merely as a trading commodity. 
However, among the insular Celts, salt became associated with beliefs that fairies, dangerous and mischievous creatures, were nearby. As a result, Celts started carrying salt with them all the time as fairies detested salt, and salt could preserve one from fairy mischief. Legends of the Celts told stories of people nearly taken by the fairies but then quickly discharged, only to find a few grains of salt in the seams of their pockets. Therefore, during dangerous periods like Samhain, people could pass through fairy sites safely if they carried salted meat or fish. The Celts also used iron in the form of nails and scissors to keep away fairies. It is unclear why fairies avoided the Celts' trade items or whether they were pre-Celtic deities who fled the Celts bearing salt and iron.
