Sabrina is thought to be either a British goddess or a figure from folklore. Evidence from both insular and continental sources suggests that a goddess with this name was worshipped as the divinity of the Severn River in Britain. This fits with the belief that many Celtic goddesses were associated with the river in whose watershed they were located. Like other goddesses, Sabrina became a popular figure in folklore rather than religion. English poet John Milton incorporated her into his famous "Masque of Comus," a dramatic entertainment based on the legend of Locrine, the king of Loegria, and his defeat by an invader named Humber. Locrine had a subject who was a beautiful woman named Estrildis. Humber became attracted to Estrildis despite being married to the powerful princess Gwendolen of Cornwall. Instead of choosing between his wife and his fancy for Estrildis, Humber hid Estrildis in an underground chamber where she gave birth to Sabrina. Later, Humber brought Estrildis and Sabrina forth from their underground chamber when his powerful father-in-law died, believing he was free from any consequences for his infidelity. Gwendolen was outraged at her husband's betrayal and led her father's troops against him. After defeating him, she demanded that Estrildis and Sabrina be drowned in the Severn. This legend reinforces the interpretation of Sabrina as the spirit of the river.
