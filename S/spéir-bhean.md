The spéir-bhean, an Irish heroine, is a late portrayal (16th–18th century) of the goddess of Sovereignty, whose right vested kingship in Ireland. This figure was depicted by the Bards as a beautiful young woman, likely from the Otherworld, who roamed the roads in search of the true ruler for the land. Her name was sometimes referred to as Cathleen Ni Houlihan, or at times as Roisin Dubh, also known as Dark Rosaleen. Other times, she took the form of the Shan Van Vocht (Sean-bhean Bhocht) or the "poor old woman," who recalls the Hag that could become young upon being kissed by the right ruler. William Butler Yeats portrayed the most famous version of the spéir-bhean in his play, Cathleen ni Houlihan, written for Maude Gonne, the revolutionary leader.
