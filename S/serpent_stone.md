A round glass object, known by various names including serpent stone, serpent's egg, druid's glass, serpent bead, Clach Nathrach, and Glaine Nathair, is a symbol of great significance. The Druids, for their divination and healing needs, used several methods but nothing was as powerful and mysterious as the serpent stone. According to the Roman author Pliny, emperor Claudius executed a warrior of the Vocontian Gauls just because he was carrying an ovum anguinum, or a serpent's egg, to court. Pliny mentioned that the Romans were afraid of this magical object, which could only be formed during a particular phase of the moon in summers as countless serpents hissed and writhed around each other, secreting a ball of liquid from their bodies that they hunted into the air. Despite the fact that this is a precise description of the mating habits of some snakes such as the garter snake, in which a group of male snakes swarm around a single fertile female wriggling about, attempting to fertilize her, except for the ball of liquid, the serpents apparently generated the stone for their own use. The furious reptiles would set out in desperate pursuit of anyone who stole the object, and only a swiftly galloping horse could outrun them. The addition of water to the path, as the snakes would get hampered by a running stream, was the only hope of survival. Although Pliny reported seeing one as massive as an apple, typically, serpent's eggs were about the size of a nut. The usage of the stone was not limited to lawsuits, as it was also believed to have healing powers. The stone was used to cure individuals who were believed to be bewitched. In such instances, dipping the stone in a glass of water was believed to be a sufficient cure. Despite the absence of druids, these stones were still revered in folklore as potent medicine. In the 19th century, serpent stones were said to appear amidst heather, where snakes had left their saliva after slithering in a circular pattern.
