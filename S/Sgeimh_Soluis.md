Irish legend talks about Sgeimh Soluis, a heroine who stood up against the Fianna, a group of warriors led by Fionn Mac Cumhaill. After Fionn's passing, the Fianna's actions turned violent and greedy, causing them to fall out of favor. As a granddaughter of Cormac Mac Airt, the high king of Tara, Sgeimh Soluis refused to pay tribute to the Fianna before her marriage. In retaliation, the Fianna attacked her, and she courageously fought back, leading to the Battle of Gabhair, where they were ultimately defeated.
