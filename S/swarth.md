A Scottish figure from folklore is the swarth, a magical copy of a person. One must be careful when encountering the swarth on the road, as seeing one's own image is often an ominous sign of death's coming. However, if one is brave enough to converse with the swarth, they may attain magical knowledge and the ability of Second Sight.
