Found in the southeast of Ireland, Slievenamon - also known as Slievenaman, Sliab na mBan, Mountain of the Women, and Sliabh na Bhan Fionn, the Hill of Fair Women - is a significant Irish mythological location. The hill was named in commemoration of the rivalry of Irish women who aimed to be intimate with Fionn Mac Cumhaill, the heroic but aging figure. Ultimately, the winner of the competition was Graínne, who may have been swift and agile, but fickle of heart. At her wedding feast, she noticed the attractive hero Diarmait and fled with him by casting a spell upon her husband-to-be and the wedding party or possibly drugging them.
