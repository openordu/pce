A newly discovered Celtic deity named Senua was found in 2002. Her silver statue was excavated from a hoard of 26 precious objects buried in the earth at her shrine in Hertfordshire during the late third century, possibly due to an impending catastrophe. Senua was believed to be a water goddess worshipped at a small spring and associated with healing. The Romanized sculpture, despite being heavily damaged by the passage of time, depicted Senua in the guise of Minerva, while votive plaques in the British Museum provided scientists with her name. The event of her emergence from the ground after being buried for over 1,600 years is a testament to the fact that it is impossible to discern which elements of Celtic mythology are still shrouded in mystery to the modern world.
