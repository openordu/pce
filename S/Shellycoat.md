In the port of Edinburgh resided the monstrous Shellycoat of Scottish folklore. This enormous creature dwelt in the water and would conceal itself beneath a shell-covered coat, waiting to attack sailors attempting to venture out to sea. Shellycoat was only vulnerable when it removed its coat and left it under a rock. At that point, it would lose all its power and be at risk of being attacked.
