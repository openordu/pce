A folkloric motif that existed in ancient Celtic lands, whether it be on the Continent or on the islands of Britain and Ireland or in areas of the New World where people of Celtic heritage settled, is the belief in the existence of individuals who can see things invisible to the physical eye. According to the findings of Folklorists, this belief could have originated as a degraded remnant of the Celtic belief in an Otherworld that was occasionally visible but commonly hidden. These beliefs were rooted in Celtic religious beliefs, and the Druids and other Bards, who were thought to be seers and not just verbal artificers, employed certain Divination methods that were believed to permit them to see hidden aspects of the past, present, and future. A person possessing second sight was referred to as taibhseaer in the Scottish highlands, and the vision per se was called taibhs. While the term da-shealladh did not directly translate into English as “second sight,” it referred to "two sights,” for it was believed that everyone could perceive ordinary reality through “one sight,” and only certain individuals could see the otherwise invisible world. The Otherworld included the Ghosts of the deceased who could walk among the living, unseen by many but as real as a living body to the second-sighted individual. People with Second sight could also see the Fetch, a duplicate person who appeared before death and walked the path the funeral procession would take, as well as Fairies, who were visible only at certain times and places to individuals with normal vision. Second sight was a unique trait that was not necessarily considered a gift, and seers rarely desired it, often wishing to be rid of it. In anyone who underwent a spiritual awakening or trauma, the condition could manifest, although it was typically hereditary.
