Continental Celtic goddess Sequana (Sequena) lent her name to the River Seine. Fontes Sequanae (“springs of Sequana”), situated close to Dijon in France, served as the source of the river and was an essential place of worship for Sequana. Here, archaeologists uncovered a Roman-era shrine where a crowned woman, with her arms upraised, was mounted on a boat shaped like a duck, holding a berry in its beak; hundreds of coins were offered to her bronze image. The waterbird was Sequana's emblem, making her unique among Celtic goddesses, as most others, such as Rhiannon, were associated with birds of prey. By combining the healing ability of the river goddess with the bird goddess's aspects, she might have possessed great power. Another Gaulish river goddess, Natosuelta, who shared Sequana's association with a bird, had the Raven as her emblem, which was typically linked with death. The many bronze and silver models of legs, eyes, breasts, and a range of body parts discovered in the river source give us an insight into Sequana's therapeutic abilities, as such offerings often signified the organ in need of healing. Romans kept Sequana's name as she was an important goddess, and her devotees, perhaps the Sequani tribe who might have thought of her as their divine ancestor, never assigned a Latin name to her.
