A small red-brown land mammal known as the stoat played a role in Irish mythology. Resembling a weasel, the stoat was attributed with human-like characteristics such as living in families and engaging in rituals for the deceased. They were also seen as mischievous and capable of theft, and their saliva was believed to be poisonous to humans. Encountering a stoat before embarking on a journey was considered unlucky, but this could be reversed by treating the creature like a neighbor.
