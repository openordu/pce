A figure of British folklore known as skriker (meaning trash) was believed to appear before death, similar to the Banshee. The skriker was often seen wandering in the forests of Yorkshire and Lancashire while screaming, or practicing Shape-Shifting, a skill common among other Fairies, to transform into a frightening Dog.
