A River goddess named Souconna, who is believed to have been a Continental Celtic deity, was possibly a ruler of the Saône River in eastern France, which was named after her in ancient times. Although, it's unclear if there were two goddesses both named Souconna, since an inscription mentioning Souconna was discovered at a location distant from the river.
