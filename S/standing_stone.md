Majestic stones of mythic significance can be found throughout the ancient Celtic lands. These stones, resembling pillars, can be found standing alone or in groups known as Stone Circles. Pre-Celtic peoples who belonged to the Megalithic Civilization erected these impressive monuments over 6,000 years ago, showcasing the civilisation's exceptional engineering skills and profound religious beliefs. Interested readers may also want to look into Dolmen for further reading.
