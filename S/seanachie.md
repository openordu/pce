Irish rural culture, until the late 20th century, had a crucial figure - the seanachie or storyteller. This figure is a remnant of the ancient Bard who was once responsible for preserving the history and myth of the Irish people. The seanachie would narrate tales based on the same ancient material, though they were often degraded by time and distance.
