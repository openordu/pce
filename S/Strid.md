West Yorkshire's Strid, a site of British folklore, can be found near Bolton Abbey. The narrow pass in the River Wharfe is home to a local legend of a goddess of the watershed, Verbeia. On Beltane morning, it was believed that Verbeia would appear riding a white horse. It was cautioned that any who crossed the river after her appearance should do so with care, as it was believed that her arrival prophesied death from drowning.
