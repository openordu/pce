Sul, or Sulis Minerva, was a British goddess. The city of Bath, located in central southwestern England, boasts hot springs that bubble forth daily, at a rate of one million gallons. These springs are referred to as Aquae Sulis, meaning “the waters of Sul,” by the Romans, who considered them to be a significant hub for commerce and Healing. In a way, Aquae Sulis was like a combination of Lourdes and the Mayo Clinic, where people came to take a dip in the steaming waters and hope for a cure for their ailments. Although the baths were buried due to silted-up deposits for many centuries after the exit of the legions from Britain, in the 17th century, they were rediscovered by antiquarians. Currently, the main bath’s great columns are exposed to the sky, and from their level, one can see the medieval cathedral located above the once-buried Roman baths. In Roman times, the goddess of the thermal springs was connected with their healing divinity, Minerva or Minerva Medica, which results in Sul being referred to as Sulis Minerva. A bronze sculpture that was found in the temple precinct depicts Sul as a warrior maiden. Many inscriptions, most of which are from ancient times, were deposited in Sul’s waters, indicating that the shrine was extremely active in the past. More than 6,000 coins have been discovered from the spring, most of them being of Roman origin. It is assumed that Sul is the local manifestation of Water goddesses present in other Celtic lands. Finally, her name, Sul, suggests that she was a goddess of the Sun since it is related to words that imply both “sun” and “eye”. Despite the clear association, certain scholars persist in seeking a male sun divinity in the region. Furthermore, they go as far as to hypothesize that all inscriptions to Sul actually contain a misspelling of the word for “pig.” As a sun goddess, Sul would be linked to other figures, such as Brigit, who in Ireland was linked to holy Wells that were considered sacred for their healing properties despite the absence of any thermal effects. Like Brigit, Sul was attended to by a group of priestesses who maintained an eternal flame. In some instances, Sul is referred to in a plural form (see Suleviae); in other instances, Brigit is given the same name.
