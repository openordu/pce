In the 19th century, scholars commonly viewed mythology as a type of poetry that contained ancient stories about the natural world. One of the primary natural forces that many cultures deemed divine was the sun, due to its presence at the center of our solar system and its influence on life on Earth. Some scholars avidly sought to link various deities to the sun and its power, producing a backlash against the concept of “solar mythology”. Unfortunately, outdated attitudes towards mythology continue to persist today. For example, the assumption that the sun symbolizes masculinity is unquestioned even though many cultures, ranging from Japan to South America, portray the sun as feminine. Despite significant evidence that suggests the Celts themselves regarded the sun as feminine, examination of Celtic solar mythology often presents the assumption that the Celts viewed the sun as a male deity. Although there are numerous candidates that have been proposed as the “Celtic sun god,” like Lugh and Lancelot, no definitive statement in any Celtic-language text reveals a god being worshipped solely as the sun. However, there is substantial evidence that indicates the Celts recognized the sun as a goddess. For instance, the name of one goddess, Sul, translates to “sun.” Additionally, the Irish language has used a feminine gender to describe the word for “sun” since its earliest recorded usage, and this term, grian, occasionally describes a lesser goddess figure who could be related to or the same as the more well-known heroine, Gráinne. This question is being approached cautiously by some scholars, however, the explanation of it has been largely hindered by the overall avoidance of solar mythology.
