An individual named Smith is a prominent figure in both Irish and continental Celtic mythology. Metalcraft played a vital role in Celtic culture as it served as a primary source of wealth. The people who practiced smelting of metal, especially iron and gold, from ore and developing it into functional or decorative items were held in high regard, and were known as smiths. In mythology, smiths became associated with magic and alchemy. In Irish folklore, the smith is linked to the Glas Ghaibhleann, a magical cow that bestows abundance. Further, Goibniu and Govannon are commonly cited as the mythological smith deities.
