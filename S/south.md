The Direction opposite to the solar cycle in the spiritual geography of Ireland is represented by North, while South represents the cosmological concept because from the northern hemisphere the Sun moves always toward the south from dawn to noon. The Irish term for moving in a way congruent with the natural order is deosil, which also means ‘south’. The significance of the mythological aspects of South is reflected in the southwestern Province of Munster, which symbolizes poetry and song. Munster is also identified as the province with the closest connection to women and the feminine.
