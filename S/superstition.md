Cosmological concepts include the persistence of superstition despite the evolution of religion. Typically, when one religion gives way to another, the former does not vanish completely. Instead, its beliefs and rituals persist, though the context and significance can be forgotten. One example can be found in Celtic territories where consuming horse-meat is widely shunned despite being a nutritious food in other regions. This may have originated from the previous veneration of horses among the Celts. Additionally, ideas surrounding creatures like the Banshee and other Fairies, currently viewed as superstitious, actually represent earlier belief systems that have remained in a less developed form.
