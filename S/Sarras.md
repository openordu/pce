The origin of the Grail and the endpoint of the knights who went on a quest to find the sacred object was at the Sarras Arthurian site. The name of the site is believed to have been derived from the word “Saracens” which was used in the medieval era to refer to the warriors from East Mediterranean or Islamic regions. According to certain writings, the location was the site of the demise of Galahad.
