The salmon is a mythical figure in Celtic lore, often representing wisdom, potentially due to the fish's incredible life journey. After hatching from eggs in freshwater pools and rivers far inland, the salmon travels to the ocean where it lives for several years. Despite scientists' limited knowledge of how the salmon navigates back to its place of origin, the fish possesses an unerring ability to do so, returning to the pool or river where it was hatched to spawn before dying. During the spring spawning season, salmon migrate up rivers, providing sustenance for animals and humans alike. The salmon of wisdom appears in various significant myths of the Celtic world. In Ireland, the salmon of wisdom is known as Fintan, a one-eyed elder who has lived through many lifetimes. Meanwhile, in Wales, the salmon of Llyn Llwy is the most ancient and wise being on earth. Additionally, Gaulish Celtic sculptures depict fish in situations that suggest a connection between the salmon and wisdom was shared by Celtic people on the continent. The most complex stories regarding the salmon of wisdom are found in Ireland, where the fish resides in a pool or well surrounded by enchanted Hazel trees. This pool is known as either the well of Segáis or Connla’s Well and is said to be the source of the Boyne and Shannon rivers. It is a liminal place that connects the mortal world and the Otherworld. Hazelnuts fell from the trees and dropped into the water, bringing forth bubbles of inspiration called eó fis which contained all the knowledge in the world. The fish that lived in these waters ate the hazelnuts, thus becoming wise. According to some legends, extra nuts were washed out into the river and could be obtained and eaten by a seeker of wisdom. However, more often than not, the fish itself had to be caught and devoured by a human for the wisdom to pass on to them. The salmon of wisdom was only ever tasted by two individuals. The great hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill, while serving the druid-seer Finnéces as a boy, sucked the grease from the cooking fish off his thumb and thus absorbed all its knowledge. This fish was known as Goll Essa Ruaid, the one-eyed salmon of Assaroe, after the pool beneath the mythological waterfall where it lived. The goddess Sínann also tasted the salmon's wisdom after catching it from the pool beneath the white mountain Cuilcagh in Co. Cavan. However, the well flooded and drowned her along with the wisdom she had absorbed. Though the mythological salmon of wisdom has survived into recent times in Irish folklore, red-fleshed salmon have come to be seen as fairy creatures from the Otherworld. People visit holy wells, even those dedicated to Christian observance, in the belief that the salmon or trout living there could bring good fortune to those who saw them. Healing attested to have taken place upon sighting a fish jumping from a sacred well is an event that persists to the present day in certain areas of Ireland.
