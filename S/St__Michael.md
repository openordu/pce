St. Michael is both a Scottish and British saint and a hero of folklore. He is known in Christian cosmology as one of the archangels who, in the face of opposition from the bright angel Lucifer, refused to abandon the divine will and instead stood with God in a great battle among angels. Michael is also mentioned in Christian legend as having witnessed the burning bush with Moses and having spoken with Abraham. He has a significant role in Scottish and British folklore, where he may represent a previous mythological hero figure like St. Patrick does in Ireland. St. Michael was skilled in removing threatening dragons from the land, a job he shared with St. George. The dragons were sometimes interpreted as pagan remnants that Christianity had defeated, or as earlier mythic beings who had been bested by a Celtic god or hero. Many sites or churches dedicated to St. Michael were built on ancient sacred areas, with the tower atop the Tor in Glastonbury being a noteworthy example. This lends further support to the theory that St. Michael's legends were influenced by Celtic or even pre-Celtic material. Michael's feast day, called Michaelmas and celebrated on September 29th, is close enough to the Autumnal Equinox that harvest festivals have developed around that time. In the Scottish islands, a unique harvest bread called struan or struan Michael was recently served as part of the ritual festivities. In Ireland, "Michael's portion" was an offering at harvest time.
