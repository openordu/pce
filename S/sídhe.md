The term 'sídhe' is a character in Irish folklore and holds a two-fold meaning. Firstly, it pertains to a Fairy Mound, which is a hill where occupants of the Otherworld reside. The mound is concealed from view for those with ordinary vision but visible to those with Second Sight. As a secondary use, 'sídhe' denotes the Fairies, which is a shortened version of the description "people of the sídhe." Numerous old tales indicate that the people of the sídhe are the Tuatha Dé Danann, who were an early group of goddess Danu's tribe. After they were defeated by the country's first human invaders, the Milesians, they were driven underground. Each significant deity was provided a specific sídhe, with examples such as Midir's Brí Léith and Úna's mounds at Knockshegowna.
