A certain figure in Irish folklore is the shoemaker, who is held in higher esteem compared to other craftsmen, perhaps due to the well-known Fairy shoemaker, the Leprechaun. These shoemakers are often portrayed as cunning individuals who can get into mischief with their wit, as is evidenced in the story of a man who acquired the art of shoemaking from the fairies, and proceeded to make shoes for the local priest who found himself unable to offer Mass whenever he wore the shoes.
