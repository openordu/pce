Irish legends recount the story of the Sons of Uisneach, also known as Usnech or Usna. The origin of their paternal name remains a mystery, as little is known about their father in the tragic tale, which is one of the Three Sorrows of Ireland, alongside the stories of the Sons of Tuireann and the Children of Lir. The narrative starts with a prophecy from Cathbad, the chief Druid of Ulster, during a feast. He predicted that the newborn, a girl, would grow to become the most beautiful woman in the world but would bring sorrow to the province. While some members of the court recommended killing the child, King Concobar Mac Nessa was fascinated and decided to raise her as his companion and lover. Leborcham, sometimes described as a woman poet or male forester, became Deirdre's guardian and mentor in court. However, Deirdre's heart was open to love, and she longed for a man with black hair, red lips, and white skin, just like a Raven she saw drinking blood from snow. Leborcham realized that Noísiu, the oldest of Uisneach's sons, possessed such beauty and arranged a secret meeting between them, sealing their fate. Conscious of the king's disapproval, the pair fled first across Ireland then to Scotland, accompanied by Noísiu's brothers, Ardán and Aínnle. In the forest of Scotland, they led a content life living off wild food and enjoying the protection of the local king. However, Concobar could not forget Deirdre's stunning beauty and plotted a deceitful scheme. He invited Deirdre and her three brothers back to Ulster on the pretense of pardoning them for past misdeeds. Despite her misgivings, Deirdre agreed to go, impressed by the messenger Fergus mac Róich's honorable reputation. Once they arrived in Ireland, the Sons of Uisneach were killed, and Deirdre met her fate. It is unclear whether her death was a result of suicide, throwing herself from a chariot, or from a broken heart. Regardless of the cause, Deirdre is forever remembered as the tragic heroine, Deirdre of the Sorrows.
