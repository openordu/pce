Scottish folklore recounts tales of the sluagh, a group of spectral entities known as the "Host of the Unforgiven Dead." Unlike Fairies, their appearances were confined to the dark hours, as they were the restless spirits of individuals who had committed transgressions during their time on Earth and were therefore unable to enter the Otherworld. Trapped in our realm, they remained unable to travel during day time or leave the darkness of night. The sluagh engaged in constant battles that left trails of blood every morning.
