A Romano-Celtic Temple found in Gloucestershire is dedicated to the worship of Sabraan, a British goddess. The temple is thought to have been established on an ancient site which stretches back to the pre-Celtic era, posing a possibility that Sabraan might have been previously linked with a goddess hailing from the same region. This goddess remains shrouded in obscurity with scant information available about her.
