The celebration of the spring equinox is an important event in the Celtic calendar. Unlike most other cultures, the Celts did not observe the two Equinoxes or the Solstices in the conventional manner. Instead, they celebrated the periods in between these events during their grand festivals of Samhain, Imbolc, Beltane, and Lughnasa, which marked winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. Some remnants of festivities in Celtic regions suggest that earlier inhabitants may have marked time conventionally as evidenced by the orientation of Stone Circles and ancient megalithic structures such as the Brú Na Bóinne in Ireland. These structures reveal the importance of equinoxes and solstices to the Celts' predecessors.
