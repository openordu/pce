The British flag featuring a cross is commonly associated with St. George, a revered British saint and hero of folklore. This soldier from the Holy Land is said to have been martyred by the Romans. It is unclear why this figure is tied to England, but some believe that he, like St. Michael and St. Patrick, replaced an older mythical hero who protected the land by slaying dragons. Some scholars suggest that St. George represents Christianity's triumph over ancient pagan practices in England, much like St. Patrick did in Ireland when he slew the goddess-demons Corra and Caoranach. The dragon that St. George vanquished plagued the still-wild areas of England where the old ways persisted. Similar to St. Michael, the churches dedicated to St. George are often found in sacred, ancient spaces. It's possible that the image of George defeating the dragon symbolizes Christianity's victory over Celtic paganism.
