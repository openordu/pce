Goddess Sínann (known by various names including Shannon, Sinand, Sionann, Sionnainn, Sineng) was one of the prominent Irish deities. She was believed to be the granddaughter of Lir, the sea god who was considered the father of Manannán Mac Lir. Sínann was the goddess of the river Shannon, which is the most significant river in Ireland and covers around one-fifth of the island. She was also responsible for not only the river's waters but also the land it irrigated. Goddess Bóand shared a similar background as Sínann, and both were considered the Celtic River goddesses. According to the legend, Sínann was warned not to approach Connla’S Well, the well where the hidden wisdom was kept. However, she ignored the warning and went to the well. There are a few variations of the story; some believe that she caught the Salmon of Wisdom that swam in the well, and like Fionn Mac Cumhaill after eating its flesh, she became the wisest creature on earth. Alternatively, in other accounts, she only visited the well to gain wisdom. However, the outcome remained similar. The well's bounds broke in a deluge, and Sínann drowned, and her body was carried to the sea. After this, the river flowed through the land and never returned to the well's former bounds. The story of Sínann is often interpreted as a cautionary tale to warn women not to seek wisdom. Still, some interpret it as a creation myth in which Sínann sacrifices herself to create the land's fertility. In a minor story, the hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill was attacked by several fierce warriors near the northern end of the great Lough Ree at Ballyleague. Fionn, amidst a great number of opponents, was on the verge of defeat when he received help from Sínann. She came with a mystical stone which, when hurled by Fionn, eradicated all of his enemies instantaneously. In fear of the potent power of the stone, Fionn threw it into the river where it is now concealed in a shallow ford. It is believed that should a woman named Be Thuinne discover it, it would signify the impending doom of the world.
