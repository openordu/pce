A Continental Celtic god by the name of Segomo (also known as Segamonas or Neta Segamonas) was once widely worshipped. This deity, whose name possibly translates to "the victor" or "the victorious one," has now become obscure. However, evidence of his past popularity is found in inscriptions dedicated to him both in Britain and Gaul.
