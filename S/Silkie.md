Silkie, a Scottish figure of folklore, was referred to as the house-goddess who donned silk clothes. She would enter houses surreptitiously to tidy up any disorderly mess left behind. It was believed that housekeeping that appeared too diligent was almost as bad as being uncleanly because if Silkie didn't find anything to clean, she would make a mess of things instead. Silkie's origins remain debatable as some link her to the harvest goddess Sele and the Fairy clan known as Silly Witches, whereas others consider her a form of Brownie. It's worth noting that the term "silkie" or "selkie" also denotes the human-like race of seals.
