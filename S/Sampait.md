A heroic figure known as Sampait (Sempait) is celebrated in the Dindshenchas as a confident and resilient woman of ancient Ireland who bore the professions of Bard and herdswoman. As the story goes, while looking after her sheep, a man of nobility named Crechmael tried to violate Sampait under the impression that he was entitled to her body due to the arousal she provoked within him. Sampait wasn't having it, so she subdued him and put him to death, as some accounts vividly describe. Whether by strangulation or a violent blow to the head, Sampait felt that the nobleman deserved to be punished for his shameful actions.
