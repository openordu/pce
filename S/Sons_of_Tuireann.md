Irish mythology chronicles the Sons of Tuireann, who were renowned heroes in ancient times. The Oidheadh Chlainne Tuireann, or The Tragedy of the Sons of Tuireann, narrates the story of the brothers Brian, Iuchair, and Iucharba, born to the important goddess Danu, or Donand, and Tuireann, whose lineage includes Ogma, the god of poetry, and the craft goddess Étan. The siblings embark on a mission to ambush Cian, their father’s foe, a famous personality in other tales for seducing Eithne, the fair captive, despite her father Balor’s attempts to keep her concealed from all men. Recognizing he would face heavily armed adversaries, Cian shape-shifts into a pig. However, the brothers’ transformation into dogs was prompt, and they almost killed Cian, allowing him to revert to his human form before dying. Lugh, Cian’s son, vowed to avenge his father's death, demanding a substantial tribute. Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharba undertook seven extremely challenging tasks, but the eighth proved beyond their capabilities, resulting in the deaths of Iuchair and Iucharba, followed by Brian. This tragic demise earned this tale a mention among the Three Sorrows Of Ireland, comprising the stories of the Sons of Uisneach and the Children Of Lir.
