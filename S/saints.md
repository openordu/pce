The Catholic Church has established an intricate process for canonical saints to be declared venerable, blessed, and finally saintly. Pope John XV implemented this system in the 10th century. Prior to that, popular opinion determined sainthood, allowing pagan divinities, including the Italian deity St. Priapus, to be recognized. Pope John Paul II reformed this in 1983, eradicating overtly haywire figures. Nonetheless, certain individuals of questionable historical veracity, such as St. Brigit, who resembles a Celtic goddess of the same name, remain. These beings, or mythical story elements, have been attributed to non-mythical humans, such as St. Ailbe, who was fed by wolves, and St. Finnbar, who slew dragons. Several factors might explain these mythological additions; for example, a folkloric process or monkish writers constructing literary characters by combining historical reality with mythological motifs.
