Obscure in legend, but not in practice, was the Shoney Scottish god who was once revered by the fisher folk of the Isle of Lewis and Harris. Dating back to the 1600s, a tradition was upheld every Samhain, where a mug of Ale would be poured into the sea in honor of the deity, who was believed to fill the boats with fish in exchange for the offering. It has been speculated that Shoney was the inspiration for the seamenâ€™s mythical guide, Davy Jones.
