Objects' shape or form, according to the cosmological concept of sympathetic magic, had an impact on similar objects in many cultures and mystical traditions around the world. For instance, a girl who combed her hair in the evening at home could draw the dangerous Mermaid's attention, as the Mermaid combed her hair at the same hour and enjoyed drowning sailors. In addition, another type of sympathetic magic postulated that parts always held a connection with the entirety. Thus, discarded hair and nails had a subtle influence on the individual who had originally owned them. (For more information, refer to External Soul.)
