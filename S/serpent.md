The symbolic animal known as the serpent (or snake) exists in all Celtic mythologies. Although the snake was not present in every Celtic country, it is frequently depicted as the companion of a divinity. On the European continent, the snake was a typical symbol of warrior gods due to its connections with wealth and fertility, often portrayed with Horns that suggest a combination of reptile and mammal. The Ram-Headed Snake was commonly associated with the woodland god Cernunnos. The Romans associated gods who accompanied snakes with their divinity of commerce, Mercury. The alleged eradication of snakes from Ireland by St. Patrick was impossible as they are not indigenous to the island although they do appear in myth. In Celtic mythology, the snake is usually represented as female figures like she-monsters Corra and Caoranach. There are various interpretations for the dispatching of the serpent goddess such as Christians arriving and disputing with an older, goddess-honoring paganism, or perhaps as a hidden seasonal myth where the serpent goddess represents the winter goddess who then gives way to her double, the blooming spring. Patrick may have taken the mantle of serpent-destroyer from an earlier hero god because in the Dindshenchas we find the god of healing, Dian Cécht, slaying a serpent who would otherwise have devoured all the cattle in Ireland. Although snakes do exist in Britain, the adder was particularly appreciated in mythology as the only poisonous snake native to the island. It was known to be very wise but also very wily. In the context of the Scottish Highlands, there was a connection between the adder and the Cailleach, who was believed to have the power to regulate the weather.
