On the Salisbury Plain, stands Stonehenge, a well-known monument from the ancient world. For many years, people wrongly attributed the construction of the great Stone Circle to the Celts who lived in the area long after its erection in 4000 B.C.E. The builders of Stonehenge lived so far back in time that we have no knowledge of their identity, language, or beliefs. However, the resemblance of Stonehenge to other such monuments, such as Carnac in Brittany and Brú Na Bóinne in Ireland, has led scholars to recognize the Megalithic Civilization - named for its enormous constructions. Similar to other megalithic structures, Stonehenge was built in accordance with astronomy. It is precisely aligned to allow for a specific moment of illumination on the morning of the summer solstice, while Carnac and Newgrange at the Brú na Bóinne were aligned to the instant of sunrise on the winter solstice. Despite being unaware of who the builders of Stonehenge were and what they believed, we can acknowledge that they had remarkably accurate knowledge about the solar system. While the original significance and myth of Stonehenge have been lost, it has been the subject of many legends over time. A 3rd-century B.C.E. writer, Apollonius, claimed that Apollo's temple constructed it and referred to its worshippers as Hyperboreans ("beyond the wind god Boreus"). Later, stories attributed the construction of Stonehenge to the great magician Merlin, who was believed to have completed it in a single day, magically transporting the stones from Ireland through levitation. These stones were formerly known as the Giants' Dance as they were previously carried off from Africa by Irish giants through enchantment. The surprise appearance of a massive building, where there had been only flat land the night before, led to legends that credit the Devil with building Stonehenge all in one night. According to one story, as he chuckled at the locals' amazement, a monk interrupted his bragging, and the Devil threw a large stone at him, which hit his heel, thus becoming known as the Heel Stone. However, there is a bit of truth to these legends. The stones used at Stonehenge come from as far as 26 miles away and were likely carried or rolled on logs, although teleportation is considered unlikely. Despite scholarly consensus that there is no connection between the Celts and Stonehenge, John Aubrey, a local antiquarian and writer in the 17th century, argued that the site was a Druid temple. Today, the Order of British Druids, founded in 1781, claims the right to perform rituals inside the Stonehenge circle, dressed in white robes in the early morning light. While their presence may evoke the image of Celtic peoples within the circle, there is no documentary evidence of Celtic use of the site, and their ceremony can only be described as imaginative theater.

- Gildas and Bede, two important historians of the era, make no reference to a man named Patrick, which has caused some commentators to doubt that he ever existed. Although that is a minority opinion, most writers agree that folkloric and mythological motifs gathered around an historic figure, so that anything written about Patrick must be viewed with great caution in terms of its historicity. According to the various Lives written in early Christian times and the two autobiographies reputed to have been written by the saint himself, Patrick was born in Britain to a family of well-off Romanized Celts. Even such a genteel upbringing was insufficient protection against sea pirates, who kidnapped the lad and sold him into slavery in Ireland (traditionally, in Ulster). For six years, until he was 22, Patrick was a farm worker, apparently learning the language of his captors. Then he escaped and made his way to the Continent. There, he experienced a vision in which he was instructed to return to Ireland in order to convert the inhabitants to Christianity. Legend does not record what kind of training he received for this mission, but it tells much about his arrival in Ireland. Proselytizing among his former captors, Patrick used his knowledge of Irish religion in order to explain the mysteries of Christianity. The best known of his evocative explanations is his use of the Shamrock, probably the common clover, to show how the Christian divinity can have three persons (father, son, holy spirit) while being still one god.

- Patrick employed the familiar Celtic motif of triplicity in an innovative fashion (see Three). The shamrock speech was said to have occurred on “Easter,” although the pre-Patrician Irish Celts would not have celebrated that Christian feast. Rather, they were celebrating the springtime festival of Beltane, which involved lighting fires on hilltops across the land. As the people waited expectantly for the fire to blaze from the top of Tara hill, home of the high king, they were surprised instead to see a light from an inconsequential little hill nearby. The druids rushed to Slane to see who dared such a sacrilege and found Patrick there over his offending fire. Most of Tara’s court was, according to legend, easily converted, but some of the Druids did not wish to give up their power to the new hierarchy of priests and monks. Thus there are a number of legends in which Patrick was said to engage in combat with the druids—legends that are filled with un-Christian imagery suggestive of the Celtic worldview. In one such story, Patrick was challenged to a magical combat by a druid, who enchanted a garment that Patrick was to wear. Patrick did the same, and the druid died horribly after putting on his garment, while Patrick’s associate escaped unharmed (the great saint did not, apparently, risk putting on the enchanted garment himself). Some druids continued to threaten Patrick, but he passed through their midst without their seeing him. He could read in the dark by the light of his own glowing fingers.

- Rain never touched him no matter how severe the storm. Such magical events are clearly legendary rather than historical. The insertion of a druidical prophecy claiming that Patrick would come to convert the land seems a later interpolation designed to support the claims of the new religion. In several legends Patrick directly confronts the pagan world that his religion replaced. In one such story, he encountered the princess of Connacht one morning at the holy spring of Ogalla, where they had come to bathe. The girls, Eithne and Fedelm, mistook Patrick and his monks for druids and began to discuss religion with them. Learning that Patrick served a new god, the girls asked questions that give insight into the religious expectations of the Celts at the time, asking, for instance, where his god lived, whether in the earth or the sky or the sea? Satisfied by Patrick’s answers, the girls accepted baptism and then died instantly, to assure themselves of remaining unstained by sin. In a similar tale, Patrick encountered Oisín and Caoilte, members of the heroic Fianna who had been stolen away and carried to the Otherworld. (Variants of the tale say Patrick met only one, usually the poet Oisín.) He debated with them which religion held more promise, showing Christianity to be the more hopeful worldview, and thus converted the pagan sages. Such literary texts are useful in gaining insight into what values and ideals Celtic Ireland held, as well as those brought from abroad by the proselyting Christians. Also legendary were Patrick’s combats with various Otherworld powers. He split the Hag Garravogue into four parts with his staff;
- He battled the water monster called Caoranach, sending her to a watery death (or perhaps not, depending on the legend consulted);
- he fought with the demon Corra atop the mountain now called Croagh Patrick in his honor;
- he smashed the idols of Crom Cruach. And, in the most familiar legend, he drove the snakes out of Ireland. "Serpent." Accessed Month Day, Year. https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/serpent. That last is entirely fabricated, as there were no snakes in Ireland at the time of his coming.
- this has been typically interpreted as indicating the driving forth of pagan Celtic divinities from the land. Many sites in Ireland that are now devoted to reverence of St. Patrick were originally pagan sites that were Sained or converted with the coming of Christianity. The most prominent of these is Croagh Patrick (locally known as “the Reek,” from a word meaning “mountain”), the pyramidal mountain where Patrick is reputed to have fought with the demon Corra before flinging her into the sea at the mountain’s base. Ruins have been found on Croagh Patrick’s summit suggesting that religious observance there stretches back into the neolithic period, some 6,000 years ago. Today it is the best-known Patrician site in Ireland. On Reek Sunday in late July (see Lughnasa), thousands of pilgrims climb the steep path to the summit, some of them barefoot, some on hands and knees. St. Patrick’s feast day of March 17 is celebrated as a holiday in many countries where Irish influence has been strong. It was not traditionally a day of national importance in Ireland itself until recent times, being more typically an ethnic celebration of descendants of the Irish diaspora.;
