A concept well-known to the Irish and Scottish is the practice known as 'saining'. This term connotes the act of purging pagan associations from a holy place that has been identified as sacred. For instance, St. Patrick of Ireland consecrated several wells by dipping his pastoral staff in them, and thereby provided protection for the sites under the safety of Christianity. The outcome of this process of 'saining' was that the place became safeguarded against any harmful spirits or Fairies, which were viewed as residuals of ancient deities dating back to Celtic and pre-Celtic times.
