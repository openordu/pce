Irish hero Sreng may not have the same level of fame as his opponent Nuada, who he battled one on one in the initial conflict of Mag Tuired. Sreng hailed from the Fir Bolg tribe and was tasked with confronting the invading Tuatha Dé Danann. Upon recognizing the magical prowess of his foe, Sreng anticipated his own people's inability to defeat them. Despite Sreng's warnings, his people disregarded his advice. In the ensuing fight with Nuada, Sreng removed the king's arm, leading to his dethronement.
