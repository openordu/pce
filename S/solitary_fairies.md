Folkloric figures known as solitary fairies are found in both Irish and Scottish folklore. They were categorized into two types: Trooping Fairies, who enjoyed socializing and celebrating with their own kind, and the ill-natured solitary fairies who preferred to spend their time alone. The miserly Leprechaun, a fairy shoemaker famous for hoarding his wealth, was the most well-known solitary fairy, while the cautious Cluricaune was another.
