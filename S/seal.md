A creature of Scottish and Irish folklore, the seal, also known as the seal people, silkie or selkie, is a sleek furred mammal that inhabits the cold seas. They are commonly found along the west and northern coast of Ireland, occasionally on the east coast near Skerries, in many coastal regions of Scotland, and most notably, on the Scottish islands. On land, seals tend to live in large colonies and in the water, they are strong and graceful swimmers that feed on fish and other sea creatures. While seals are a significant part of the Arctic people's diet, in Ireland and Scotland, consuming seal meat was frowned upon and considered a form of cannibalism. The notion that seals are enchanted beings, sometimes referred to as fallen angels, is evident in both Celtic lands, at times being confused with Mermaid legends. This idea may have originated from Celtic culture or another cultural stratum. The appearance of the seal people in Scandinavian folklore may suggest that it has an ancient derivation from that region. Some scholars have commented on the claims made by certain coastal families regarding their seal ancestry. These families include the Coneelys, Flahertys, MacNamaras, Sullivans, and many families on Achill Island in Ireland, the MacPhees on the Hebrides, the MacCondrums on the Scottish mainland, and all fair-haired people on the Isle of Skye. This may indicate an ancient totemic system since members of these families are prohibited from killing seals or consuming their meat, pointing in the same direction as the taboo. Seals do bear some resemblance to human beings, particularly in their wild moaning calls and their soft dark eyes' direct gaze. Fishermen in certain regions were known to communicate with seals through speech or song. It was believed that the seals would respond, usually pleading for their safety and that of their young. In Donegal, which is located along the northwest coast of Ireland, there existed a belief that seals were humans disguised in fur clothing. Women from this group were regarded as excellent partners except that their children possessed webbed fingers and toes. Just like with Swan Maidens, a man had to steal their animal-hide garment and keep it hidden, because if a seal woman ever found it, she would immediately vanish into the ocean. A number of stories claim that silkies were formerly human girls who drowned at sea and were transformed. Women could also acquire seal lovers by sitting on isolated rocks and weeping into the sea. The lovers were typically affectionate and tender-hearted but had a tendency to abruptly disappear. Seals currently gather at Sule Skerrie in Orkney, which is home to the Great Silkie of a well-known ballad from ancient times. The creature sang, “I am a man upon the land, I am a Silkie on the sea” as a strategy to lure a human woman into giving birth to his half-seal child. The child then returned to the ocean but was killed by the woman’s husband while in his seal form. Only relatively recently did the concept of the seal maiden inspire American director John Sayles’s movie, The Secret of Roan Inish, where several seemingly over human children find out that they are silkie offspring.
