Descendant of the Fairy king Midir and the son of the unruly daughter of Midir named Ogniad, Sigmall is considered an heroic figure of the Irish mythology. Despite the fact that it is uncertain if Midir's partner Étain is Sigmall's grandmother, it is believed that Étain co-exists eternally with Sigmall in the Otherworld.
