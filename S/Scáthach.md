An Irish heroine, Scáthach (also known as Skatha, Scáthach nUanaid, Scáthach Bunand, Scathach) was one of the legendary Warrior Women of Ireland. Her home was on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, which was named after her. Scáthach transformed aspiring warriors into heroes and was the only one who possessed the secrets of doing so. Her most notable student was the great Cúchulainn who vowed to find her, even if it meant dying while attempting to cross the Bridge of the Cliff - a chasm that could only be crossed by performing the great Salmon-leap. Though not certain, some believe that the leap could be related to the salmon of wisdom. Scáthach’s curriculum was arduous and included the learning of martial arts with peculiar names like thunder-feat, apple-feat, supine-feat, salmon-feat of a chariot-chief, and using weapons like staff, blade, spear, and rope. The students also learned the hero’s call and the use of the magical weapon Gáe Bulga. Scáthach taught her students to not just become heroes but also predicted their future. However, for Cúchulainn, she refused to do so as she foresaw that he would kill his only son, Conall, who was incidentally her grandson in some versions of the story. In other versions of the tale, Cúchulainn battled with Scáthach for control of Skye. After days of endless combat, they shared the hazel nuts in which the earth’s wisdom was hidden. Through his inner vision, Cúchulainn realized he would never succeed against Scáthach, and he left the island, bequeathing it to the warrior woman. Comparisons have been drawn between the gift given to the hero by Scáthach, known as the Gáe Balga, and the legendary sword Excalibur bestowed upon King Arthur by the enigmatic Lady Of The Lake. Some authors utilize stories of female warriors like Scáthach, as well as notable historical figures like Cartimandua and Boudicca, and references made by classical writers regarding Celtic women's military abilities in order to argue that Celtic women participated in warfare alongside men. However, others reject such arguments by pointing out existing laws that restrict women's actions or offer them protection in times of war.
