Continental Celtic deity Sirona (also known as Dirona or possibly Tsirona) was considered a Healing goddess, with several inscriptions in France and other continental Celtic territories invoking her name. Her name is often translated as "star." Even though Sirona was frequently associated with the Celtic Apollo, she was also revered as a standalone figure. The goddess was often depicted with serpents and eggs, indicating her tie to rebirth and fertility.
