Cake is mentioned in relation to the Irish hero Sualtaim mac Roich, also known as Subaltach or Sualtach. Sualtaim is famously the foster father of Cúchulainn, a great hero of Ulster. The reason why Sualtaim became pregnant with the princess Dechtire is because she drank water in which a magical Worm was swimming. Sualtaim himself isn't a major player in myth, but he does warn the court of Emain Macha about the progress of queen Medb's armies in the Táin Bó Cuailnge. Unfortunately, while quickly turning on his horse, the Grey of Macha, he decapitated himself with his own shield. Even though he lost his head, it kept calling out warnings until the men of Ulster woke up from Macha's curse and protected their land.
