Indech is a prominent deity in Irish mythology. According to the great tale of the second battle of Mag Tuired, Indech was a Fomorian champion who injured the god Ogma of the tribe of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the opposing army. Indech was the offspring of a fertility goddess named Domnu, who was considered to be a variation of Danu, the chief goddess of the Tuatha Dé Danann. The lineages of characters in Irish folklore are often intricate and complex in this manner. Some scholars contend that the different "clans" of deities symbolize the numerous migrations to the island, and that the union of these immigrants resulted in interrelations among their gods and goddesses.
