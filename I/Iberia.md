The landmass currently known as Spain and Portugal was once a significant location for the Celts. Indeed, the area was a stronghold for this ancient group. In terms of mythology, a connection exists between Iberia and Ireland. The Book of Invasions discusses one set of mythological migrants - the Sons of Míl or the Milesians, to be precise. It is from this group that the alternative name for Ireland, Hibernia, derives. Furthermore, one of the group's mythological forefathers, Míl Despaine, translates to “Spanish soldier.” For information on Hy-Brâzil, please see I Breasil.
