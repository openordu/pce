Islands were considered by the Celts to be mythical sites that exist in a state of liminality, not quite in this world and not quite in the Otherworld. As such, they served as gateways between worlds (see Liminality). Other natural sites, such as bogs, stone circles, hills, and springs, as well as man-made sites, such as hillforts and hearths, share this marginality with islands. Celtic tradition is rich with mythological islands, including Avalon, the Isle of Apples, where King Arthur was guided by the Lady of the Lake; the Isle of Women, an island or islands in the western ocean ruled by a beautiful queen and inaccessible except by her will (see Tir Na Mban); and Hy-Brâzil, a magical island that was only visible once every seven years. Additionally, there exist real-life islands that are surrounded by tales and myths, such as the small Island of the Living in Munster, Ireland, where no person has ever died or ever will die, and Inisbofin off the Connemara coast, where the mythological white Cow appears every seven years. Scotland's Hebrides are referred to as the Isles of the Blessed, and are described as lands where budding and harvest occur simultaneously. Though not factually correct, this is consistent with descriptions of Fairy islands.
