Folklore and fairy tales abound with references to the dreaded power of iron over the fairy folk. To keep fairies at bay, it was customary to carry nails in one’s pocket when passing a fairy rath, to place nails in the bottom of milk pails to prevent the fairies from stealing the milk, and to hide a nail in a bed where a mother was giving birth, so as to ensure that the child would not be snatched away and replaced by a changeling. Iron crosses were believed to be effective in repelling fairies, and even an open pair of iron scissors held to form a cross could serve this purpose. These traditions are found across the Celtic lands, but their source remains unclear. The Celts were among the earliest peoples in Europe to successfully work iron; their famous metalworking skills brought them great prosperity through commerce with other cultures. In fact, the very word “iron” comes from a Celtic term, iarn, which was eventually adopted into Latin and spread throughout Europe. Some scholars believe that the fairy people may originally have been the gods of pre-Celtic peoples, and their legendary aversion to iron could reflect a historical conflict with the metalworking Celts.
