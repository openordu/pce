Inchiquin, an Irish mythological site, rests near the small town of Corofin on the Burren, a wild rocky area of west Co. Clare. The area features the small gray Lake of Inchiquin which is believed to have had a magical past. According to legend, three beautiful women resided in underground caves at the site, and every night, they came forth near a sweetwater spring. The lord of the area heard about them, and upon spying on them, he became enamored with one of the women. He stole her from her sisters and brought her to his fortress, where she became his wife and bore him several children. Despite consenting to marry the lord, the woman imposed a condition that prohibited him from inviting anyone home. She was not alone in that, considering that fairy women who agree to marry humans often exact some such promise from their husbands. The lord agreed to the promise, but one night while out with friends, he broke it. He arrived home with guests only to find his wife and children departing for the spring from which she had come. The man never regained her as his wife, for the spring's waters began to rise until it became the lake that now hides the entry to the fairy realm.
