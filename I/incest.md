Myths involving incest, particularly between siblings, have been interpreted as creation myths since, at the beginning of time, the only means of populating the world would have been through incest. Several Celtic myths contain implications of sexual relations between brothers and sisters. One myth entails Arianhrod who bore two sons to prove her purity through magic, but sources indicate that her brother Gwidion fathered the children. Another myth involving incest portrays King Arthur, who fathered a child with his sister, the mystical Morgause. These unions are frequently used to attest to the original divinity of figures who have been reduced or portrayed as human.
