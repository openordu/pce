A figure of Scottish folklore known as iorasglach, or iorsglach-úrlair, has been noted to appear in some Highland folktales as a seer. This character, typically portrayed as a woman dressed in shabby clothing, is known to strike the ground where she sits before delivering prophecies to the lord and court. Scholars believe that this beggarly figure could be a distant recollection of a Celtic or pre-Celtic ritual of Divination.
