Ireland received the name Island of Pigs due to a mythological event involving the invading Milesians and the enchanting Tuatha Dé Danann who resided there. The land was covered with an enchantment cast by the magical residents, making it seem like a small pig-shaped island instead of its actual lush and green appearance. This site is also known as the Island of the Blessed, which is synonymous with the Fortunate Isles.
