An appearance in the Book Of Invasions is made by Íth, an Irish hero. He was the first Milesian to spot the green island of Ireland on the horizon and led a group of his people there. However, he was quickly killed by the magical Tuatha Dé Danann, who were the residents of the land. His murder was then avenged by his nephew, Míl Despaine, who successfully invaded Ireland with the Milesians.
