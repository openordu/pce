In Celtic mythology, the concept of immortality is vague. Although some authors describe the Celtic gods as immortal, the tales of battles of Mag Tuired talk about the deaths of many of them. Thus divinity's concept of immortality in the sense of never facing death is unclear. Gods and goddesses can also be victims of treacherous murder, as with Medb who was struck down while bathing. Nonetheless, some Irish legends tell of food that, when gods eat it, it kept them young and healthy. Examples include the Pigs of the sea god Manann√°n Mac Lir, the ever-full Cauldron of the blacksmith Goibniu, and Apples from the Otherworld. The myths show that without such enchanted food, divinities might age and pass on like mortals. However, the texts and tales do not describe any deaths resulting from old age among the gods. Some ancient sources mention that the Celts believed in the immortality of the human soul that passes through different bodies, which is more accurately termed Reincarnation or metempsychosis. But others argue that rebirth in different bodies was not part of the Celtic vision of the afterlife but a classical misinterpretation, and that the Celts believed in the soul's reawakening in an Otherworld that was a mirror image of this one, only timeless. Whether one believes in rebirth or reawakening, they both suggest that death is a change in form instead of an ending. Such a notion clarifies why Celtic warriors were always fearless, as ancient writers described.
