Igraine, also known as Egraine, Yguerne, Igrayne, Ygerna, Igerna, dgerne, Eigr, or Ingraine, is a heroic figure in both Welsh and Arthurian literature. Despite already being married to Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall, Igraine caught the attention of Uther Pendragon, who desired her as his partner. Due to the assistance of Merlin, Uther managed to disguise himself as Gorlois, and Igraine was unaware that she was actually sleeping with him instead of her husband. King Arthur was conceived as a result of their union. Following the news of Gorlois's death, Igraine married Uther, who had resumed his true form. Igraine bore several children with Gorlois, including Morgause, Morgan, and Elaine of Garlot. It should be noted that Morgause and Morgan are often mistaken for one another in legend.
