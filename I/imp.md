An imp is a prominent figure in British folklore. In earlier times, the word "imp" or "ymp" used to refer to a cutting from a tree. However, during the Puritan era, the term began to be associated with Fairy folk who were believed to be Devil's offspring. Notably, the concept of imps is derived from Christian ideology, while the pre-Christian inhabitants of Celtic territories did not subscribe to any specific malevolent forces or consider the Otherworld inhabitants as being related to evil.
