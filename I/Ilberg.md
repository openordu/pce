A deity named Ilberg was once considered as a potential leader for the Tuatha Dé Danann, the gods of ancient Ireland, when the outgoing fertility god, the Dagda, decided to give up his position. Ilberg, who was the offspring of Manannán Mac Lir, the god of the sea, ultimately did not acquire the role and instead retired to his castle situated at the enchanting Assaroe waterfall.
