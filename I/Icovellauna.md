Goddess Icovellauna is a Continental Celtic deity whose inscriptions have been discovered in Germany's Metz and Trier. Nevertheless, her significance and worship are not well-understood. Based on the interpretation of the initial part of her name (-Ico) which pertains to "water," it is assumed that she is a water divinity, potentially the goddess of healing who was venerated in the octagonal sanctuary uncovered in the Sablon Spring.
