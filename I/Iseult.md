Iseult, also known as Isolt, Isolde, Essyllt, or Essellt, is a Cornish or Breton heroine who features in a great romance alongside her lover Tristan, in opposition to her husband King Mark. This love triangle is reminiscent of the famous British love triangle of Guinevere, Lancelot, and Arthur. Mark, who is the king of Cornwall, fell in love with Iseult after he discovered a single strand of golden hair so beautiful that he immediately dispatched his handsome young nephew Tristan to Ireland to find the woman who it belonged to. On their return voyage, they became becalmed at sea and Iseult, who was thirsty, offered Tristan a drink that her mother had brewed for her wedding night. Her mother hoped to prevent Iseult from entering into a political marriage by using her knowledge of herbs to make a potion that would cause intense and unbreakable love between the two who shared it. Although Iseult had strong feelings for Tristan, she resisted him physically and instead became the bride of Tristan's uncle and king. Iseult's maid Brangien, feeling guilty for having served the magic potion, took Iseult's place in bed with Mark on their honeymoon. Despite Iseult's attempts to remain faithful, she began to secretly meet with Tristan. Her husband grew suspicious and subjected her to a magical test of her purity; if she was impure in any way, she was supposed to drown while crossing a stream. Aided by Tristan, who was disguised as a beggar, Iseult was able to cross the stream unharmed, enabling her to truthfully profess that no man other than her husband and the helpful beggar had touched her. The two lovers, due to the agony of their deceitful actions, were forced to separate, causing them to live wretchedly without each other's cherished and adoring company. Tristan went on to marry a woman with Iseult's name (see Iseult Of The White Hands), but upon hearing a false report that Iseult had passed away or was never going to come to him, he died of heartbreak. Iseult too lived out the rest of her days in misery and eventually passed away. Numerous scholars discern a typical Celtic pattern in this tale of ill-fated romance – the goddess of Sovereignty's choice of the king, without whose approval no man can ever expect to rule. Besides the echoes of Arthurian legend present in this tale, its love triangle is also discovered in the Irish narrative of Fionn Mac Cumhaill and his bride Gráinne, who elopes with the handsome Diarmait at their wedding. However, the protagonist in the Irish tale is considerably less a victim of fate and male desire, and significantly more active in the romance.
