Iubdan, an Irish hero, is the focal point of the early Irish Adventure tale called Eachtra Fhergus Mac Léide. In this tale, we meet the boastful king, Iubdan, who is king of the Faylinn, along with his queen, Bebo. In an attempt to contain Iubdan's excessive bragging, his poet, Eisirt, told him that nearby Ulster was inhabited by giants - a claim which was proved when the poet Áeda, who was actually a dwarf, was invited back from Ulster. Eisirt then placed a Geis, an unshakable demand, on Iubdan that he must taste the porridge of Fergus mac Léti, the king of Ulster, before the next dawn. Iubdan, taking his wife Bebo along, set out to satisfy the geis but ended up falling into the porridge. They would have drowned if they hadn't been rescued and fished out. King Fergus takes a liking to the tiny queen and keeps her as his mistress for a year and a day after which Iubdan purchases their freedom by using a pair of flying shoes. Jonathan Swift's satirical commentary on humanity, Gulliver's Travels, features a famous Lilliput section that has been linked to the adventure tale of Iubdan.
