A site of Scottish mythology is found in Iona. The island, situated in Scotland's Inner Hebrides, is now best known for being the center of Celtic Christianity which was founded by St. Columcille. Previously, it was believed to have been a Celtic shrine for a goddess named Ioua. In fact, the island was originally named after the goddess herself who is thought to have been associated with the Moon. There are alternate beliefs that tie the island's name to a sacred tree called Yew that was associated with death and sacred places. Additionally, it was said that the holy Well on the island rose directly from the Cauldron of the Tuatha Dé Danann - the mythical tribe of the goddess Danu. The Well's name, Tobar na h’oige or “fountain of youth,” suggested that it conveyed the cauldron's power of immortality to the surface world. Those who gazed into the Well at dawn or dusk, or on the night of the full moon, would receive healing and visions. While as a Celtic site, it welcomed both men and women, under Christianity, women (except for nuns) were prohibited from residing on Iona. Despite this, there is a church on the island that contains a self-exposing, pregnant female figure known as a Sheela Na Gig.
