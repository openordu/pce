Cosmological concept known as Interpretatio Romana, outlining the Roman interpretation of Celtic gods upon their arrival in Celtic lands. Upon encountering this complex group of divinities, the Roman legions discovered that the gods were not organized into a hierarchical pantheon nor were divine duties assigned to specific gods. The Celts revered individual gods and goddesses, each linked to specific places instead of abstract concepts. To bring order to the perceived chaos, the Romans renamed the Celtic gods. Healing goddesses became Minerva and healing gods became Apollo, while powerful gods were renamed Mars, and gods of commerce or prosperity became Mercury. In some cases, the original Celtic name was combined with the new Roman name, such as Sulis Minerva at the healing springs of Bath, and Mars Lucetius in the same place. Conversely, in other places, the old names were disregarded, leading to many inscriptions and sculptures depicting Jupiter dressed in Celtic garb and wearing neck rings called Torcs. Unfortunately, the original names of such gods are now lost to history. Unlike the Celts who did not traditionally depict their gods in human form and worshipped in outdoor settings, the Roman gods were worshipped indoors. The building of Temples and sculptures featuring the Horse goddess Epona was an innovative practice in Celtic lands, introduced by Roman soldiers and ultimately adopted by Celts who were conquered. These temples and sculptures, which were inspired by classical originals, retained certain native features. While most of the inscriptions, temple ruins, and sculptures come from the Continental Celtic peoples, there is a significant number in the island of Britain as well. On the other hand, Ireland has no tradition of interpreting native divinities as Roman ones as it was never invaded by the Romans. The reinterpretation continued under the Rome-based Christian church, which understood that people resist having their ancestral divinities taken away from them. Instead of assuming that Celtic gods and goddesses were aspects of the trinitarian god, Christian evangelists followed Pope Clement’s suggestion to preserve the ancient holy places and turn old gods into saints to be incorporated into the new religion. Therefore, some Celtic saints, such as Brigit, have pagan origins.
