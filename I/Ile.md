Eila (also known as Ile or Yula) was a deity from Scotland. Islay, one of the larger islands in the Hebrides off the west coast of Scotland, was named after this goddess. She is sometimes referred to as Yula of Denmark, a queen or princess. Even though Ile is not a well-known figure, the island named after her is famous for being the location where the Lords of the Isles were inaugurated in a traditional Celtic ritual. During the ceremony, they stepped on a stone with footprints to receive their office. For more information on the significance of these stones, please see Inauguration Stones.
