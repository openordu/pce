In this literary text titled "Intoxication of the Ulstermen" from the renowned Ulster Cycle, king Concobar Mac Nessa persuaded his foster sons, the renowned heroes Cúchulainn and Fintan, to let him govern their lands for a year. Eventually, the king departed to celebrate the restoration of their lands to their initial rulers, planning to spend the earlier part of the evening with Fintan in the west and the latter part in Cúchulainn’s eastern territory. However, after consuming too much alcohol midway through the night, the warriors failed to locate Cúchulainn’s fort, leading them to their enemy, Cú Roí, who tried to entrap them in an iron house and then it on fire. As anticipated, Cúchulainn realized that his expected guests were lost and rescued them. Thereafter, the Ulstermen razed Cú Roí’s palace. The Intoxication of the Ulstermen is one of the stories that revolve around drunkenness and portrayed as taking place during Samhain, the winter feast held on November 1st.
