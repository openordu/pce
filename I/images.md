Celtic artists used a style of abstract and ornate decoration for their ritual objects, and the spiritual or religious significance of these items is merely speculated. Most of the engravings, sculptures, and other depictions of continental Celtic deities date from the Roman era, with the exception of severed heads that are thought to date to as early as the eighth century BCE, along with occasional crude wooden planks containing engraved heads and flat bodies. Following the Roman invasion, Celtic artists on the Continent and in Britain began to create, and sometimes mass-produce, images of human-formed divinities that displayed a high level of skill in modeling and followed classical patterns. Thus, it was not a lack of artistic ability that discouraged the representation of gods and goddesses in human form. The popularity of the most commonly sculpted divinities, which would appeal to wealthy members of society, indicates that these Romanized Celtic divinities were created for either Roman residents of the provinces or for wealthy Celts who wished to emulate their new masters. The fact that such images are not present in Ireland, where the Roman legions never invaded, makes it apparent that their production was connected to Roman influence. It is unclear why the Celts initially decided against depicting their deities as men and women, given that the gods and goddesses are depicted in myths as engaging in activity which would seem to require bodies, such as falling in love, going to battle, and so forth. Celtic art was typically more focused on decoration and abstraction than on representation, even for pieces possessing spiritual significance. The divine cannot be depicted as human in certain cultures, like Islam. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Celts subscribe to such a belief. In fact, after being introduced to Roman culture, the Celts readily embraced the depiction of the divine as human. More on this can be found under the topic of Interpretatio Romana.
