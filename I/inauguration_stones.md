Celtic kings were believed to be invested into their role while standing upon a sacred stone, as per both historical and literary evidence. The most famous of these stones was the Lia Fáil, which was thought to have been brought from the Otherworld to be placed atop the hill of Tara in Ireland. It is said that the stone visible today on the site is not genuine, and that the original Lia Fáil was brought to Scotland in ancient times to serve as an inaugural stone for 34 Scottish kings. It is believed that this original Lia Fáil, also referred to as the Stone of Destiny, was taken to Westminster Abbey in London by Edward I in 1296 and used beneath the English coronation throne for the inauguration of every British monarch, except Mary I. The Stone of Scone was later returned to Scotland in 1996 but doubts remain over whether the next British monarch will go there to be crowned upon the sacred stone. The fact that the Stone of Scone is not the original Lia Fáil is supported by the tradition that the Lia Fáil was supposed to scream when touched by the true king; however, there is no historical evidence stating that the Stone of Destiny screamed upon the coronation of Scottish or English monarchs. In Celtic lands, the tradition of inaugural stones includes other notable stones besides the famous Stone of Scone. For instance, the stone next to the Guildhall in Kingston-upon-Thames was used to crown seven Saxon kings during the 10th century. Additionally, the Black Stone of Iona was located in the Strathclyde cathedral until 1830 when it disappeared; beforehand, it was often utilized by highland chiefs to witness contracts and oaths. Although, the Stone of the Footmarks, which was situated on the Scottish island of Islay, was where the chiefs of the Clan Donald were inaugurated. The incoming ruler stood barefoot in the footprints that had been carved into the stone to take their oath of office. Unfortunately, that inaugural stone was intentionally destroyed during the 17th century. Ireland also had other inaugural stones that were distinct from the mythical Lia Fáil. For example, near Belfast, the O’Neills received their inauguration whilst sitting in a stone chair that was last known to have been bought as a garden ornament in 1750 before going missing. Though another stone chair, the Hag’s Chair, can be seen at the top of the Cairn-studded hill of Loughcrew, it has only a slight legendary connection with the tradition of inaugurations.
