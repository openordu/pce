Conaran, a goddess of the Tuatha Dé Danann, had three daughters who were all skilled in the magical arts, including Irnan, an Irish heroine. When the Fianna, a heroic band of warriors, were captured by the daughters, they used their magic to spin a web that held the men fast. Goll Mac Morna came to do battle with them and killed Irnan’s two sisters, but the web still held even when he threatened Irnan with death. Irnan agreed to break the spell, but instead turned into a monster and demanded that the three Fianna warriors fight her in a single combat in the traditional Celtic fashion. However, Oisín, Oscar, and Celta, the heroes, all refused, leaving their leader Fionn Mac Cumhaill to do battle. In fear of Irnan's power, Goll ultimately stepped in and killed her, leading to a curious tale with no connection to any of the major myth cycles. Nonetheless, it reflects the common theme of heroes killing Hag-monsters and may hide an ancient creation tale where a goddess is killed to make the earth. To learn more, refer to Garravogue.
