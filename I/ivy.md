Symbolic of the summer season to the Celts was the ivy; a rapidly growing, almost rampant, vining plant classified under the genus Parthenocissus. In the continuous cycle of seasons, the Ivy King was known to oppose the Holly King. Alternately, the ivy was also referred to as a feminine plant, set in contrast to its masculine counterpart, the Holly.
