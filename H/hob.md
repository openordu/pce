A well-known figure in British and Scottish folklore is the hob, also known as hobtrust, hobtrush, and hobgoblin. This syllable hob is typically found in words associated with Fairies and is believed to be a diminutive form of the name Robert, given to English Brownies or helpful household spirits. The flattering name Robin Goodfellow originates from the same root. In northern Britain, the hob was viewed as a kind spirit that was helpful to local residents for tasks like Healing or farm work. However, it was essential not to reward the hob in any way, as that would scare it off (refer to Laying The Fairies). Folklore also includes less kindly hobs such as Hob Headless, a frightening figure that haunted a road near the River Kent. Hob Headless was confined under a rock for 99 years, capturing passersby who rested on his rock and gluing them down, preventing escape. This is consistent with the hobgoblin category, a term used to describe malicious spirits. In Scotland, hobgoblins used to cause misery and mischief for their own pleasure, taking on terrifying forms to intimidate people walking at night. Even a haystack could become a menacing apparition, coming alive in the night and scaring travelers into either an exhausting run or a useless fight with an invisible foe. According to variant legends, encountering one such apparition indicated impending death.
