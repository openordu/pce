Celebrated in Scotland, Hogmany (or Hagmany) is a festival that takes place on the last day of the year. This day is sometimes referred to as "the night of the candles" or "the night of the pelting," and it involves a range of traditional activities that are rooted in the Celtic viewpoint. Candles are kept alight throughout the night, and houses are decorated with Holly. Interestingly, boys are whipped with the branches of the Holly for their own protection, with each drop of blood drawn believed to assure them of good health in the coming year. In addition, a man dressed in a cowhide bellows through the streets, while men and boys follow him, throwing snowballs and striking him with a switch to create a loud boom. This lively procession follows the sun's course (see Directions) and makes its way around the village three times. They strike each house for good fortune, demand treats or money or both, and recite a nonsensical rhyme. Upon being welcomed into a home, the Hogmany party offers the caisein-uchd (a sheep's breastbone on a stick) to the household, to be placed in the fire and held to the noses. Such bizarre customs originate from protective rituals intended to ensure that the participants remain healthy throughout the new year, and they may have earlier been used for divination purposes.
