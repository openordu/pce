Agricultural divinity, Hu Gadarn or Hu the Mighty, is the primary deity worshiped by some contemporary Neo-Pagan cults claiming to be adherents of Druidism. While his origins are believed to date to the Middle Ages, it is possible that he is a remnant of an earlier deity. The Warren Stone, a significant rock near Buxton, holds a place in British folklore as the site where Hulac Warren, also known as Hector Warren, was turned to stone as punishment for his attempted rape of the maiden Hedessa, who transformed into a spring. The story invokes similarities to Greek mythologies centered on Apollo's pursuits of various nymphs, and may be an amalgamation of classical and native tales.
