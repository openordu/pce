British mythology tells the story of Henwen, a goddess of abundance in the form of a magical sow. Early in creation, she ventured through the hilly countryside, birthing litters that did not consist of piglets but rather strange combinations of life. In various parts of the country, Henwen brought forth a grain of wheat and a bee, a grain of barley and a bee, as well as a wolf cub, an eaglet, and a kitten, each adding to the diversity of the world.
