A cosmological concept, heaven was not perceived by the Celts as being in contrast or as a complementary pair with earth. The absence of a myth depicting the union of heaven with earth or their coerced separation, as exhibited in other cultures, is an indication of the fragmented stories which typify the Celtic worldview. This worldview is comparable to that of shamanic cultures, as demonstrated in various myths. Unlike Judeo-Christian cosmological beliefs, which propose heaven as a dwelling for both the divine forces and the dead, the Celts positioned both in the Otherworld. This Otherworld is situated out to sea, beneath a hill, or, in contrast to our world, within an imperceptible universe, but never in the sky.
