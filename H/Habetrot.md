The British folkloric figure Habetrot, also known as Gyre-Carling or GyCarlin, was once a spinner goddess who could weave garments for people that would protect them from illness. After Christianization, she was reduced to a Fairy spirit but remained a healing presence. In certain regions of Britain, she appeared as the Fairy Queen who would steal unspun flax at the end of the year. In a Scottish border tale, a lazy girl who was ordered by her mother to spin seven hanks of yarn hurt her fingers and went searching for a stream to soothe them. She came across an old spinning woman who gave her seven hanks spun by ghostly, twisted-mouthed women. The girl's skill with the silky thread attracted a handsome lord, and they were married. The girl brought her husband to see Habetrot, who showed him the deformed spinners and predicted that his new lady would soon look that way. The lord was horrified and made his wife stop spinning, allowing her to live an idle and happy life.
