Located in the southwestern province of Munster, the scenic valley of Coom Callee, also known as Hag's Glen, is an Irish sacred site associated with the powerful figure of the Hag named the Cailleach. Legends say that a hag once cared for a child in the glen and that their footprints were left imprinted on a rock. The glen is part of MacGuillycuddy's Reeks, making it part of Ireland's highest mountains. In the mid-19th century, villagers gave the name of the Cailleach to an old woman who lived alone in the Glen, further reinforcing the identification of the valley with the mythological hag.
