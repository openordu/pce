Archaeological sites that contain Celtic hoards are typically found in bogs or locations where items can be hidden, and may consist of gold Torcs, decorated Cauldrons, and lunae or moon-collars. Scholars theorize that these treasures were deposited in bogs as a way of safeguarding them against possible theft by invaders, possibly Vikings. It's also believed that hoards may have been left as Sacrifice during times of disaster, such as epidemics or other threatening occurrences.
