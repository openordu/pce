Symbolizing Ireland, the harp is a significant object. In ancient times, it was linked to the god Dagda, who was believed to be kind. Its presence indicated violence running rampant, as it indiscriminately killed anyone in its path. The Dagda harp comprised only sleep, grief, and laughter melodies. A comparable mythical harp exists in the Welsh story of Kulhwch And Olwen. Refer to Craiphtine for further information.
