Celtic artists had a tradition of representing their gods in a non-human form; however, with the arrival of the invading Romans circa 200 BCE, they started to depict them based on classical figure modeling. Moreover, the Interpretatio Romana practice, which involved renaming Celtic gods with Roman deity names, encouraged artists to carve the deities with Celtic and classical features and to identify them with Roman monikers. Hence, the Greco-Roman hero, Hercules, frequently emerged in Celtic art, especially on the Continent, as an alternative version of the Celtic gods, some of whose identities are lost, while some are known. Deities such as Segomo, Borvo, and Smertrius are portrayed as brawny, robust gods bearing Herculean clubs, but their significance to their communities remains unclear. Borvo, for example, is connected to the healing springs in Aix-les-Bains, which implies that his role might have been to combat illness rather than other deities. According to Lucian, a Greek author from the second century CE, the Celtic people considered verbal talent as a kind of strength, which led them to depict the god of eloquence, Ogmios, as Hercules.
