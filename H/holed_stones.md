Symbolic objects, holed stones were commonly used throughout Celtic lands to seal marriage vows. These stones were also utilized for healing purposes, as discussed in the topic of "Healing Stones." Couples in love would clasp hands through the natural holes of the stones while making vows to each other. In certain areas, it was deemed that a church wedding was not fully official unless vows were spoken at one of these holed stones. Referred to as Dobie Stones in Britain, they were associated with the Fairies of the same name.
