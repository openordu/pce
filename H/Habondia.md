Germanic or Celtic goddess Habondia, also known as Abundia or Abunditia, lent her name to the term "abundance." She symbolized an earth or harvest deity and, while discovered in Celtic territories, her origins may be Germanic. Habondia was recognized by medieval Witch-hunters as the specific divinity of those they pursued.
