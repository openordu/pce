A creature of British folklore or mythology was known as Herla. It was thought that in Herefordshire, a king named Herla from ancient times still roamed the land as a small, half-animal man riding atop a large goat. Herla was trapped in the Otherworld many centuries ago and was destined to lead the Wild Hunt, known as Herla's Rade, on moonlit nights. According to some sources, Herla passed on this responsibility to an English king and rested in the Otherworld thereafter.
