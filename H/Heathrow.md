A pre-Roman Celtic settlement which originated in the fourth century B.C.E., Heathrow British archaeological site, now referred to as an airport in London, boasts of impressive square earthworks, once surmounted by a timber Temple and encircled by a colonnade of posts. Temple buildings in other Romano-Celtic regions share a similar square-within-a-square architectural pattern, implying that the design can be traced back to Celtic religious views.
