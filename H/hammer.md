The image of a hammer as a symbol of Celtic divinity was prevalent among the continental Celts, known as the "god with the hammer". This deity's various names included Taranis, Dis Pater, Silvanus, and Sucellus, and he was typically depicted as a strong, mature, and bearded figure. Although sometimes interpreted to represent storms and thunder, there is no defined indication that the hammer was considered meteorological in meaning. Some other interpretations link this god to fertility of the earth, rather than the sky, evidenced by the fact that he often carries a cup, a common symbol of earthly energy. While a minority view, some commentators believe that the hammer symbolizes the blighting force of winter, although that is not commonly held. It is conjectured that the club or mallet carried by the Dagda may be the Irish version of the hammer.
