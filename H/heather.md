Symbolic of the moors, heather is a robust plant found commonly in Ireland and Britain. Its low-lying growth in wild areas can be carpeted with delightful pink or purplish flowers during the summer. Heather is adored by bees who use it to make a honey that has gained popularity as a delicacy in some parts of Scotland. Despite being considered a "peasant" tree in Ireland, heather remains a part of the Tree Alphabet.
