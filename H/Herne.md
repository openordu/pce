A figure of British folklore is Herne. Shakespeare, in The Merry Wives of Windsor, references Herne as a hunter who committed suicide by hanging himself from an oak tree, and was then compelled to haunt the same woods where he died. Herne the Hunter appears in multiple legends depicted as a horned spirit, hinting that he may have originated as a woodland deity such as Cernunnos. A story from Windsor Forest depicts Herne using Fairies' typical language, as he was believed to shoot invisible darts at those who intruded upon magical locations. (See Gwynn Ap Nudd.)
