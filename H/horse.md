The horse was a significant animal to the Celts, not only for religious and symbolic purposes but also practical ones. They were famed throughout ancient Europe for their horsemanship, particularly in warfare. Horses were a vital aspect of Celtic life and were considered a means of transportation and a symbol of nobility. Celtic nobles rode in chariots as they were more prestigious than riding on horseback, while lesser warriors made up the mounted cavalry. Nobles were often buried with their horses and gear, demonstrating a bond in life that was not severed by death. The use of horses in Celtic death rites may originate from their association with the sun; many cultures view the sun as carrying the dead away at sunset and renewing them at dawn. Celtic coins with solar and equine symbols imply a connection between horses and the sun, as the spoked wheel, which is a double image of the sun and the horse-drawn chariot, was closely associated with the goddess Epona. Epona was the champion of the Celtic cavalry during the Roman occupation and was venerated throughout the Roman Empire. Others have contended that the nursery rhyme that goes, "Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross, to see a fine lady upon a white horse," may contain a faint folkloric allusion to Epona. Similar connections have been made to the semi-historical figure Lady Godiva, who rode on horseback without clothing to protest against her husband's oppressive taxation policies. On the Continent, Epona was a revered goddess among the Romans, who utilized her as the goddess of the cavalry. Romano-Celtic sculptures and reliefs often depict Epona, the goddess associated with fertility and equine abundance, on a horse, surrounded by other horses or foals, or offering feed to horses. The Celts considered these animals sacred and had a taboo against eating their flesh, a prohibition that persists in parts of contemporary European cuisine. However, the taboo was lifted during sacramental occasions, such as the midsummer festival, which involved the sacrifice of horses. In Ireland, the horse was linked with the goddess of Sovereignty through the banais ríghe, or sacred marriage of king and land goddess. The early geographer Geraldus Cambrensis recounted a strange ritual wherein the king would sacramentally mate with a white mare, which was then killed and cooked into a broth that the king drank. This ritual has parallels in other Indo-European cultures, most notably in India, but its presence in Irish royal inauguration is still debated among scholars. The Irish goddess Macha, who outran the king’s team of horses in a race that concluded in her death, is considered a counterpart to Epona. In addition, there is a post-Christian Irish folktale that states Noah mistakenly brought aboard only a mare on the ark, which was impregnated by one of his sons and led to all horses having a distant human ancestor. This strange tale may have some connection to the alleged Irish kingship ritual involving a white mare. Horses in Irish folklore were also believed to possess Second Sight and could see the ghosts of the deceased, possibly due to their ancient funerary significance. Legend has it that a person who peeked between their horse's ears would be granted the ability to see ghosts. There were instances where Fairies rode stolen horses, who were found lathered in sweat as if they had been galloping all night when they were actually confined to their stables. However, there was one horse that could not be stolen by the Fairies, known as the fiorláir or true mare. The true mare was the seventh consecutive filly birthed by a mare, and the spot where it was born was identified by the growth of Mary's Clover, a four-leafed Clover with healing powers. The rare horse would protect its rider from all harms, whether of this world or another, and was unbeatable in a race. Other superstitions attributed protective powers to horses, with burying a horse's head in the foundation of a building believed to keep its occupants safe. In Wales, the horse was connected to Rhiannon, a goddess who rode a white horse and was surrounded by singing birds. She was blamed for the kidnapping of her son and was forced to carry all visitors on her back until proven innocent, reinforcing the idea that she was linked to the horse. In England, horse figures were found carved into the chalky lands of Berkshire and Wiltshire. Eleven white horses were cut into hillsides, believed to be regimental emblems from the late 18th or early 19th century. Carving over earlier horse figures, some of the horses in the region may have been originally Celtic. The White Horse of Uffington, a widely known horse figure, has not changed in appearance for centuries and shares similarities in style with horses on Celtic coins. Experts are unwilling to give the Uffington horse a specific age, but studies of the hillside's slipping rate estimate that it dates back to the time when Celts occupied the region. The community would engage in a "scouring" of the horses, which involved clearing away the turf that would have grown over them if left untended. This tradition often coincided with fairs and markets, and the seven-year cycle of scouring the Uffington horse continued until recent times, with a recorded attendance of over 30,000 people at the festival and ceremonies held in 1780. Thomas Hughes' 1889 book, The Scouring of the White Horse, takes place during the festival and is considered to be a reliable source for local folklore.
