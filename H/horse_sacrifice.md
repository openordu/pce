In the early 6th century C.E., Giraldus Cambrensis, an early traveler to Ireland, documented a Horse sacrifice in Irish ritual which many scholars have verified as accurate. Though there are no similar accounts, Giraldus asserts that the installation ceremony of the Irish High King at Tara, the banais ríghe, required the candidate to engage in sexual intercourse with a white mare, which was then killed, boiled into soup, and eaten by the king. Despite often being labeled as "barbaric," this uncommon ritual is not to be dismissed as unlikely, as it resembles an additional Indo-European inauguration rite where the queen was expected to wear the hide of a recently sacrificed mare during ritual intercourse with the king.
