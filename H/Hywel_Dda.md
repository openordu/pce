Welsh ruler, Hywel Dda, is a celebrated figure in Welsh history, having reigned over the kingdom of Dyfed in the 10th century (circa 910-950 CE). He is most noted for his significant contributions, namely the creation of an admirable set of legal codes which were later compiled in the late 12th (and in some references, 13th) century. The resulting compilation is referred to as Cyfraith Hywell or the Laws of Hywel, recognized as the first comprehensive legal system in the country, and often likened to the Brehon laws of Ireland.
