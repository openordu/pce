Symbolic objects, the horn, antlers and the horned gods and goddesses are primary symbols of male potency in Celtic divinities. There are two major types of the horned gods, the first wearing antlers of the Stag and sitting cross-legged, is called Cernunnos, also known as "the horned one". He is considered to be a force of prosperity, and is sometimes depicted with three heads or associated with other gods. Other deities of wealth like Gaulish Mercury and Cocidius may also be shown wearing horns. The second type of horned god wears bull horns which represent leadership and power. Although horned helmets have been found on warriors or leaders, the horns themselves may refer to something else. Horned goddesses are less common than gods, while it is typical for the goddess to wear antlers crowning a female deer's head, sometimes cows' or goats' horns adorn the head of a goddess. Such goddesses may represent animal nature, a connection between female fertility and the animal world. A symbol that was exclusive to the Celtic religious belief was the Ram-Headed Snake. This symbol, which was once considered a representation of power, was later transformed into an image of evil during the Christian period. The horned appearance of the Christian Devil was directly inspired by this potent Celtic deity. Some of the traditional festival practices seem to have retained vestiges of the ancient customs associated with the horned god, as displayed during the Abbots Bromley celebration.
