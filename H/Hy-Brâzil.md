A mythical site that captivated the Irish in folklore was Hy-Brâzil (also spelled Hy-Brazil, Hy-breasal, Hy-brasil, and I Breasil). According to Celtic mythology, the island was a magical place ruled by a king named Bres, a Fairy Queen known as Niamh of the Golden Hair, or occasionally by the sea god, Manannán Mac Lir. This idyllic land, located somewhere in the ocean, resurfaced every seven years, often in different areas, always in the west. Many islands off the west coast of Ireland claimed to be Hy-Brâzil, including Inisbofin off the Galway coast. The existence of Hy-Brâzil was so prevalent that in 1908, many people claimed they witnessed the island in the Atlantic, off the west coast of Ireland, floating in an area where no island had been observed before. Belief in the existence of Hy-Brâzil persisted for a long time; the land appears on medieval European maps as a factual island, commonly situated off the coastline of Ireland. When European sailors arrived in South America, they believed the rich lands there to be the cherished land of Hy-Brâzil. Consequently, one of that continent's significant countries still bears the name of the Celtic magical island. Hy-Brâzil is sometimes mistaken for, or blended with, Otherworldly sites such as Tir Na Nog ("the land of youth") and Mag Mell ("the plain of delights"), but each mystical land has its individual and distinct qualities.
