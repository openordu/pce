Irish mythological texts contain several sequences of Irish myths that are generally classified into four cycles according to the supposed chronological order of the events: the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle, the Fenian Cycle, and the Historical Cycle. The Historical Cycle includes stories that took place between late Celtic and early Christian times (third to 11th century C.E.). Although many tales may have a basis in historical reality, they are often embellished with mythological motifs and descriptions of supernatural events. Themes of the stories generally center around the crucial political and ritual center at Tara and the Celtic concept of Sovereignty or the right rulership. The Historical Cycle presents various kings such as the 246 high king Conn of the Hundred Battles, Cormac Mac Airt, Mongán, and Guaire.
