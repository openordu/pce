British festivals feature a unique figure from folklore, the hobbyhorse. This figure's origins are believed to be traced back to early religious ceremonies, which have since deteriorated over time. A man wearing a horse puppet parades with the hobbyhorse in these festivals. It is believed that the hobbyhorse derives from Celtic practice, given the syllable hob that typically denotes a link with the Otherworld. The figure may be connected to the horse goddess Epona.
