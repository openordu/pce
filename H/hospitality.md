In Celtic Ireland, hospitality was a symbolic ritual. The king was tasked with the responsibility of distributing wealth through endless feasting and open-door hospitality. Failure to provide guests with their needs could lead to the loss of the throne, as it happened to Bres, the beautiful half-Formorian king who was forced out of power for feeding a Bard poorly. It wasn't just the kings who were expected to be hospitable; members of society were also expected to open their doors to travelers and the needy. By setting up households at crossroads, people showed their willingness to house and feed passersby. The amount of food and type of meat offered depended on the caller's social rank. Largesse was proportional to a person's means, so even an impoverished person could offer meager food, while a wealthy person was expected to prepare a lavish table. The Celtic tradition of hospitality, therefore, served as a means of resource reallocation.
