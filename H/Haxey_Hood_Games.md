In the small town of Haxey in Humberside, the Haxey Hood Games take place on Twelfth Night, the last day of the old Christmas holidays. Legend says that in medieval times, the scarlet hood of Lady de Mowbray was blown off her head on her way to church, and several men came forward to save it for her. In return, Lady de Mowbray granted the village a plot of land called Hoodland, which became the site of an annual contest among twelve villagers for a hood, still held with the guidance of the Red-dressed gobbans (boggins, boggans). The games start in the early hours of the morning with a fool's oration in the town square, ending with the words, "House against house, town against town, if you meet a man knock him down, but don't hurt him." The fool's performance culminates in "smoking the fool" - lighting a fire at their feet. Following this, the games begin as the King Gobban throws twelve hoods into the air, and the participants compete to catch one. Those who manage to get away with a hood and reach the safety of a village inn receive free drinks. Although some have suggested that the origins of this tradition date back further than the medieval period and that it is a remnant of a human sacrifice ritual, this idea has been debated.
