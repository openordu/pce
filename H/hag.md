Old, blind or one-eyed with a humpback, rheumy eyes and a hairy chin, the Irish and Scottish hag of folklore was not initially attractive to the eye. Yet, surprisingly, should one kiss her, she transformed into a stunning 6H 237 maiden in the prime of her youth. This curious reversal of appearance is a recurring theme across many tales of the great goddess of Sovereignty, as well as war goddesses such as Macha and the Mórrígan, and the Cailleach, the pre-Celtic creator goddess. In Arthurian legend, the hag appears as the Loathy Lady who incites the quest for the Grail, and as Ragnell, who enables her husband to comprehend what a woman truly desires.
