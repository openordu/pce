Hibernia is an ancient name that Greeks and Romans used interchangeably for both Ireland and, on occasion, Britain. The name refers to the perception Mediterranean peoples had of the rainy chill of Ireland appearing to be a perpetual winter. The Irish high king, also known as the ard r√≠, ard ri, ard righe, is a social role whose authority over other Irish kings remains debatable. Kings derived power from their Tuath, which is the land and the people they reign over, as well as their union with the goddess of the land. This suggests that there is a little chance for the king of Tara to have centralized political authority. Though it may seem plausible for lesser kings to report to the high king, that was not the reality. The high king occupied a religious and ceremonial office, incapable of commanding other rulers to follow his orders. Nevertheless, he bears the responsibility of maintaining Ireland's fertility by adhering to his Buada and geasa, otherwise known as his sacred vows and taboos (see Geis). Many high kings prominently feature in mythology, including Conaire, Niall of the Nine Hostages, and Conn of the Hundred Battles.
