The Celts were descendants of the Hyperboreans, a tribe documented by the Greeks as having mystical powers and the name "beyond the north wind". They were a community of peaceful vegetarians who worshipped Apollo in a large stone circular temple that some associated with Stonehenge. While initially thought to reside on the island of Britain, most ancient geographers identified their homeland as being in Europe. By the 4th century B.C.E, Greek scribes referred to the aforementioned land as the territory of the Celts, who had adopted the name for themselves, connoting "the lofty ones" or "the warriors."
