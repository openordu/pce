Celtic folklore introduces harvest dollies, which hold a significant place in the celebrations of harvest in Celtic territories. These dollies were usually crafted from the final sheaf harvested and were approximately four inches tall. On the Isle of Man, these straw images were referred to as mheillea (“harvest”) or baban ny mheillea (“doll of the harvest”), and were decorated with ribbons to form dresses, creating a personified imagery of “maidens”, which probably originated from an ancient goddess of the abundant harvest. The dollies were kept near the hearth until replaced by a similar doll after the next year’s harvest. A similar belief was held in Scotland, where the “harvest maiden” was suspended within the house to protect farms from fairy mischief.
