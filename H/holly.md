Evergreen holly, a small tree or shrub of the genus Ilex, is a symbolic plant due to its shiny evergreen leaves and red berries. The sight of holly in snowy woodlands especially around the time of the Christian midwinter feast of Christmas, made it more widely known. The plant derives its name from the Middle English word for holy. Prior to being adopted by Christianity, the holly was considered sacred by the Celts as it symbolized the ruler of winter known as the Holly King, whose counterpart was the Oak King. This ancient tradition can be traced from the Welsh legend of Hafgan and Arawn where the two kings compete seasonally. The holly is traditionally paired with the Ivy; the former depicts the masculine force while the latter embodies the feminine principle. The medieval period brought forth the famous Christmas carol, “The Holly and the Ivy,” whose lyrics and melody still resonate with traditional festivity.
