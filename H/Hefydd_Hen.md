Welsh hero or god, Hefydd Hen (also known as Hefaidd Hen or Heveidd Henn) was the father of Rhiannon, the legendary horsewoman depicted as a weakened goddess. Although there is no recorded tale that details his mythical purpose, it is possible that Hefydd the Ancient (or Old Hefydd) was an ancestral Welsh divinity.
