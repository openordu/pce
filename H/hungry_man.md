The f√©ar gortach, or far gorta, is a character in Irish folklore known as the hungry man. This figure is similar to the legends of the Hungry Grass, which causes intense hunger in those who walk on it. The hungry man is depicted as a starved beggar who stands on the side of the road with a silent outstretched hand, begging for alms. Giving food to the hungry man brings good luck. Scholars believe that this figure may have emerged after the Famine of the 1840s, although it is possible that it was based on older folklore traditions.
