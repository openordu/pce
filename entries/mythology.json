    "text": "Scholars often use the term \"mythology\" to describe the collection of stories that serve as the foundation for a particular culture's religious rituals and cultural practices. These stories often take the form of written texts, in which deities are organized into pantheons and their relationships are explained in detail. However, Celtic mythology is not defined by a single source or scripture. Rather than being written down, these stories were passed down through recitation, meaning that there are no written records of them. Furthermore, evidence of Celtic deities in sculpture and inscriptions comes from the time of the Roman invasion, when their beliefs may have been influenced by the Roman pantheon. As a result, it is difficult to discern what the Celts originally believed. Moreover, many of the literary sources we have were transcribed by Christian monks, potentially altering or adding to the original Celtic material."
