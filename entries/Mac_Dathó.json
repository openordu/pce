    "text": "An Irish hero named Mac Dath\u00f3, also known as Mac Datho or Mes Roeda. In the Ulster Cycle tale Sc\u00e9la mucce Meic Dath\u00f3, Mac Dath\u00f3 was a warrior who possessed a hunting hound named Ailbe, which was highly coveted by two kings: Concobar Mac Nessa of Ulster and Ailill mac M\u00e1ta of Connacht. Mac Dath\u00f3, unable to choose between the two kings, invited both of them and their warriors to a feast, at which he served a huge roasted Pig. In accordance with the custom that the best portion of the feast be awarded to the finest champion (see Champion\u2019s Portion), an argument ensued between the kings as to who should receive the honor. In the resulting commotion, Mac Dath\u00f3's hound Ailbe was killed, providing Mac Dath\u00f3 with a solution to his dilemma."
