    "text": "Afagddu, also known as Avagddu or Morfran, was a Welsh god. According to legend, Afagddu, which means \"utter darkness,\" was a terribly unattractive young man. This caused his mother, the Hag-goddess Ceridwen, to be concerned that he would never find a mate. As a solution, Ceridwen believed that poetry might attract even an unappealing person, so she infused herbs of inspiration in her magical Cauldron to help her son. However, when the young servant boy Gwion accidentally drank the concoction, he gained its magical powers and became the celebrated poet Taliesin. It is said that in Irish mythology, imbibing water from a sacred water-source is another way to attain inspiration, which may be related to Ceridwen's cauldron. It remains unknown whether Morfran was Afagddu's equally homely brother or another name by which he was known. There are no further tales about Afagddu after this incident of theft."
