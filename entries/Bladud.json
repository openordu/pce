    "text": "British hero or god Bladud was credited by Geoffrey of Monmouth for establishing the famous Bath spa, which was dedicated to the Celtic deity Sul. The shrine had an eternal flame of the goddess, which Bladud supposedly ignited. However, some opinions suggest that Bladud was not a human ruler but a representation of the sacred environment, or Genius Loci."
