    "text": "On the coast above the Irish town of Sligo in the western province of Connacht, one can find the famous Ben Bulben, a site widely known in Irish mythology. This dramatically sweeping peak houses a mound of stone where the romantic hero, Diarmait Ua Duibne, met his tragic demise. The hero was kidnapped by a magical Boar, to which he clung until successfully slaying the beast. Unfortunately, Diarmait brushed against the poisoned bristle of the animal\u2019s body, puncturing himself fatally. On arriving at the scene, Fionn Mac Cumhaill, who had pursued Diarmait and his love interest, Gr\u00e1inne, across Ireland for a long time, could have saved the young hero with his healing skills, but instead taunted Diarmait. Even in death, Diarmait was loved for his beauty, which Fionn took the opportunity to contrast with his gory ugliness. Today, Ben Bulben is known for also being the shadowing site of the grave of poet, William Butler Yeats."
