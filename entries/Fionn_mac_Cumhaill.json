    "text": "Fionn mac Cumhaill is known as one of the great heroes in Irish mythology. In fact, there are two great heroes within this mythology, with each of them being the center of a cycle of myths. Additionally, these heroes are connected with an era and a province. The first great warrior is C\u00fachulainn of the Ulster Cycle, who lived at the height of Celtic Ireland's power, around the fifth and sixth centuries C.E. He is connected with the northwestern province. The latter of the two great heroes is Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Fionn's warrior band, the Fianna, reminds people of the unattached bands of protective warriors that were prevalent in Ireland throughout the early Middle Ages. Due to its center being at the Hill of Allen, in Co. Kildare, the Fianna and their leader are associated with the southeastern province of Leinster. Fionn actually bears the name of his father, Cumhall, who passed away when Fionn was young. Stories regarding his father's early death vary. Some indicate that Cumhall raped the noble Murna and was subsequently killed in retaliation by the hero Conn of the Hundred Battles. However, another story indicates that Cumhall was actually innocent of any wrongdoing but still fell victim to a conflict with an opposing clan. This conflict between Cumhall and Fionn's Clan Ba\u00edscne and their antagonists, Clan Morna, forms the foundation for much of the legend of the Fenian Cycle. Other variations of the story exist as well, all of which emphasize the early demise of Fionn's father and the significance of feminine energy in his life. It was through his mother, Murna, that Fionn claimed divine descent from her ancestor Nuada of the Silver Hand, who was the king of the mythological Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. Fionn\u2019s upbringing was greatly shaped by his aunt and foster mother, the Druid Bodhmall, who not only nursed him but also initiated his education. Being the ambitious warrior that he was, Fionn\u2019s education wasn\u2019t complete until Luaths Lurgann, a skilled Warrior Woman, took it upon herself to train him in the art of combat; unfortunately, he accidentally killed her. Fionn\u2019s powers were apparent early on as he displayed impressive fighting skills while still very young. Bodhmall sent the young boy to finish his education under the hermit druid Finn\u00e9ces. Fionn, known then as Demne M\u00e1el or \u201cdruid\u2019s tonsure,\u201d was tasked with watching a Salmon roast over a fire spat, which was no ordinary fish but the famous Salmon of Wisdom, sometimes referred to as Fintan, a Bard who had amassed vast wisdom from numerous incarnations. Finn\u00e9ces had been waiting for seven long years just for the salmon to surface in the waters of the sacred Well (see Assaroe), and upon capture, he cooked it intending to devour it to gain Fintan\u2019s broad vision. When the salmon splattered onto Fionn\u2019s thumb, he instinctively put it in his mouth to ease the pain, and as a result gained all the salmon\u2019s wisdom. From then on, whenever Fionn sucked on his thumb, he would enter an alternate reality state where he could see both past and future, thanks to the wisdom he obtained from the Salmon. The salmon has been regarded as a triple representation or an intensification of Fionn himself since all characters\u2019 names in the story are interconnected. Fionn was not only born wise but he also had a natural strength and proficiency with weapons. His name was given to him after his first battle, when he triumphed over an athletic competition and then defeated a rival who challenged him. He was called \"the fair boy\", or Fionn, for short. His father's name was then added to his own, thus he became known as Fionn mac Cumhaill.\nLike other heroes, Fionn was sent to continue his studies and chose a warrior woman named B\u00faanann as his teacher. He also had a male tutor named Cethern Mac Fintain. By the time he became a man, Fionn possessed all the necessary skills to obtain fame and glory. He was known as the fastest runner in the world, never missed his target with a spear, and could swim across any body of water. Additionally, he had the unique ability to suck his thumb and know the whereabouts and weaknesses of his enemies.\nFionn, like King Arthur, gathered a group of warriors to protect his province, Leinster. These fianna groups were a true feature of ancient Irish life. Kings did not maintain standing armies but relied on these groups and their leaders for protection against invaders. However, they often fought against each other, as seen in the ongoing disputes between Fionn's Clan Ba\u00edscne and the opposing Clan Morna. Fionn shared a deep bond with his hunting dogs Bran and Sceolan, who were among his closest companions in the Fianna. His skill in battle was unparalleled, exemplified in tales such as his triumph over the monstrous Aill\u00e9n Trenchenn that ravaged the palace at Tara. Fionn is widely believed to have been originally divine, as evidenced in stories of him fashioning the landscape with his own hands, cutting mountains in twain with his sword and leaving scratches on rocks from his ascent. From the legendry of the Fenian cycle, Fionn\u2019s adventures chiefly take place in the world of mortals. One such story describes a scruffy man approaching Fionn while he was travelling through Scotland and offering to carry his baggage. The man exhibited extraordinary strength that both Fionn and his crew marveled at. In addition, he was also an accomplished hunter and cook, catching deer for breakfast and grilling them to perfection before the other members of the Fianna could even stir. However, the sight incensed Con\u00e1n, a fellow member of the Fianna, who grew jealous of the man\u2019s abilities and challenged him to a race to the Hill of Howth and back, the forfeit being decapitation. While the man refused to put up his own head, he nonetheless agreed to the contest and parted with Con\u00e1n for the hill. Along the way, the scruffy man stopped to remove pebbles from his shoe and to trim his long trailing cloak. Despite these impediments, he still managed to beat Con\u00e1n to the finish line and with a single blow made his head spin around on his neck. Con\u00e1n had done wrong, and Fionn demanded that his head be set right. The servant agreed to do so as long as Fionn took him to his home. Upon arrival, the servant was transformed into a prince as a curse he had been under could only be lifted if he entered his home with Fionn mac Cumhaill. Such folktales, which probably originated from different sources, were drawn into the orbit of the Fenians and are typical of those associated with Fionn in the oral tradition. The Fenian Cycle is unusual for placing emphasis on courtship and love, despite being an apparently masculine sequence of tales. Though Fionn had no single wife, he was linked to several women: Sadb, who was transformed into a deer, so that Fionn\u2019s son Ois\u00edn was born with fawn\u2019s fur for brows; \u00c1ine, with whom he had two sons; the poetess Cr\u00e9d; the unnamed daughter of the king of Greece; the married Maer and the unfaithful Maigneis; and many others. As he grew older, Fionn remained desirous of women but became less desirable himself. In his old age, he was betrothed to the beautiful Gr\u00e1inne, who preferred the young hero Diarmait. The story of their elopement and pursuit by Fionn, which contains realistic drama, does not show the elder hero in the best of light, particularly when he refused to heal his wounded rival. The story of how Gr\u00e1inne became Fionn\u2019s betrothed is told in the place-lore legends of the Cairn-crowned hill Slievenamon. Fionn desired a young partner and volunteered to impregnate the strongest, fastest girl in Munster, as determined by a footrace. Atop Slievenamon's cairn, a signal from Fionn caused all the young women in the province to run toward him. Gr\u00e1inne, competitive and strong, outran everyone and arrived at the hilltop first. The story suggests, however, that she never bore the heroes promised to her, although some variants claim that after her lover's death, Gr\u00e1inne agreed to fulfill her duties as Fionn's wife, bearing him several children. Fionn's death, like the story of his birth, has multiple versions. Usually, the Clan Morna's antagonists are held responsible; the head of that clan, the one-eyed Goll Mac Morna, delivered the fatal blow. Fionn's death reportedly occurred in various locations throughout Ireland and Scotland. Mong\u00e1n could have been Fionn, but historians speculate that Fionn is not dead, resting instead with the Fianna, slumbering in a cave somewhere in Ireland until his land needs him again, like Britain's legendary king, Arthur."
