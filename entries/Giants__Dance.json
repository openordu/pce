    "text": "Stonehenge, a British mythological site, has been referred to as Giants' Dance by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his geographical commentary from 1136 C.E. Numerous legends suggest a connection between stone circles and supernatural creatures such as Witches who, while partying (often on Sundays), were turned to stone as punishment. Accordingly, some believe the enormity of Stonehenge's trilithons led to the belief that the petrified creatures were giants."
