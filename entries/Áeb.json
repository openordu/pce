    "text": "\u00c1eb (also spelled Aebh or Aobh) is a heroine from Ireland who is known for being the mother of the Children of Lir in a well-known Irish story. \u00c1eb was the daughter of Bodb Derg, a powerful magician. Unfortunately, she passed away while delivering her second set of twins. Despite this tragedy, her daughter Fionnuala became the heroine of the story by taking her mother's place and maintaining loyalty to her siblings after their mother's death. Following \u00c1eb's passing, her evil foster sister, who was unable to have children of her own, A\u00edfe joined Lir's family. This led to the curse that transformed \u00c1eb's children into singing swans."
