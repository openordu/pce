    "text": "Nollaig, also known as Nadolig in Welsh, is a traditional festival rooted in folklore. Though the Celts did not observe the Solstices and Equinoxes, instead focusing on the central days of each season, there were various reasons that led to the addition of other seasonal feasts to the Celtic calendar. Before the Celts, earlier cultures recognized the solstices as observed through the alignment of pre-Celtic stone monuments with the sunrise and sunset of those days. Following the advent of Christianity, the winter solstice became especially significant as it marked the supposed birth date of Jesus Christ. This date was chosen by the Christian church to replace pre-existing winter solstice festivals, which new converts were not willing to give up. Hence, Celtic regions fashioned their winter solstice rituals, referred to as Nollaig in Scotland, likely derived from the Latin natalis translated through Welsh. This celebration is not strictly devoted to the birth of Christ, but is more commonly a midwinter festival at large, as evidenced by how it is only occasionally observed on Christmas. In certain areas, it is observed on New Year's Day, while other regions celebrate the whole week between Christmas and New Year as Nollaig. In Scotland, youngsters would form processions and visit homes, reciting meaningless rhymes that seem to link to Celtic legendary figures, with householders rewarding the singers with food and drink. The peak of the festivities was on Hogmany, or New Year's Day. In Ireland, it was customary for boys to capture Wrens which were subsequently paraded around the village amidst singing and ostentatious displays. According to Irish tradition, if one of these birds happened to die during this time, it was regarded as a blessing."
