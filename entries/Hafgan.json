    "text": "One of two rival kings of the Otherworld in Welsh mythology was Hafgan, whose name in Welsh means \"summer song.\" His perpetual opponent was the more famous king of Annwn, named Arawn. Hafgan had the magical ability to recover from any injury after suffering a second blow, leaving his adversaries with only one chance to bring him down. According to the Mabinogion, a collection of Welsh myths, Arawn requested that human prince Pwyll take his place and battle Hafgan on his behalf for one year. By exchanging their appearances through magic, Arawn governed Pwyll's land for a year, while Pwyll traveled to Annwn and reined over Arawn's throne for the same duration. After a year, Pwyll was able to defeat Hafgan in a one-on-one battle."
