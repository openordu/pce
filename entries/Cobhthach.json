    "text": "An Irish hero by the name of Cobhthach, also known as Covac, is known for perpetrating heinous acts. One of his victims was his young brother, Labhraigh Lore. Cobhthach forced him to consume mice, which caused the child to become mute from terror. Some sources describe Cobhthach as Labhraigh\u2019s uncle. In his thirst for power and control over the Province of Leinster, Cobhthach murdered his own brother, Labhraigh."
