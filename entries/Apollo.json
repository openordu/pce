    "text": "A god of both the Romans and the Celts was Apollo. The Roman legions were tasked with bringing conquered territories into the Roman empire, and one approach was to use the Interpretatio Romana, which assigned Latin names to local gods. However, when they started conquering the territories of the Celts, their hierarchical pantheon was faced with an extreme polytheism where the general Celtic oath was \u201cI swear by the gods my people swear by.\u201d Despite the challenge, they began renaming local gods - some retained their original Celtic names, while in other cases these names were discarded. Broadly simplifying the complex Celtic religion, the Romans appended the name Apollo to dozens of gods. This is ironic, as Apollo was not originally a name used by the Romans, but rather was adopted from the Greeks whom they had already conquered. In Greek mythology, Apollo was a deity related to the sun; however, the Celtic Apollos may have had little or nothing to do with the original Greek or Roman gods. Concurrently, the Celts welcomed Apollo into their flexible pantheon, and provided him with a consort who was absent from classical Apollo mythology; this consort was seen as indispensable in the Celtic worldview. As the Roman Apollo was connected to healing and light, these gods also became associated with the hot springs, which the Celts used (and still use) as centers for healing. Among the many Celtic Apollos are: \u2022 Apollo Amarcolitanus, \u201cof the distant gaze,\u201d found on the Continent. \u2022 Apollo Anextiomarus (Anextlomarus), Continental god of healing or protection. \u2022 Apollo Atepomarus, god of horses and the Sun, often linked to Cernunnos, but also to Belenus. Apollo Canumagus, a deity from the British pantheon, is associated with canines. In European and Scottish mythology, Apollo Grannus, the god of healing springs, is a significant figure and is typically linked to Sirona. The word \"Grannus\" is similar to the term used to describe the sun goddess in Irish mythology, Grian. In France, specifically around Auvergne, it was customary to pay homage to the god through a ritual involving burning wheat sheafs while chanting, \u201cGranno, my friend; Granno, my father; Granno, my mother.\u201d This suggests that Apollo Grannus could have been perceived as possessing dual or ambiguous gender traits. Apollo Moritasgus, a god of healing worshiped in France, is paired with Damona. Apollo Vindonnus, a deity known for healing eye diseases, is another esteemed figure in the Apollo pantheon."
