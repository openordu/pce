    "text": "Scholars have chronicled the existence of Powries (Dunters), which are considered as folkloric figures in Scotland and Britain. These entities are known for making loud noises in old edifices and towers. According to lore, the intensity of the sounds created by Powries would indicate the proximity of death or bad luck to those who hear them."
