    "text": "Dechtire, also known as Dechtere, Deichtine, or Dectora is a renowned figure in Irish mythology. She is either a heroine or a goddess and is famously known as the mother of the great Irish hero, C\u00fachulainn. According to legend, Dechtire conceived her child through a miraculous manner. One day, Dechtire and her 50 maidens vanished from Emain Macha, the capital of Ulster where she lived with her brother or father, King Concobar Mac Nessa. For years, no one knew their whereabouts until a flock of 51 birds appeared on the fields surrounding the capital. The birds were exceedingly voracious and consumed everything on their sight, leaving the fields barren. The people of Ulster decided to hunt the birds in order to get some food for their starving population, and also put an end to their destruction. The great warriors of Ulster, including Fergus Mac Roich, Briccriu, Amairgin, and King Concobar himself, went out on the hunt. After following the birds, they discovered that the birds flew in pairs, attached to each other by a silver chain, and one of them flew ahead wearing a silver yoke. The men tried to catch up with the birds, but to no avail. Briccriu and Fergus grew tired and went to seek shelter in a large house where they were welcomed by a man and a woman. The following day, they discovered a miraculous child. There are various versions of how C\u00fachulainn (then known as S\u00e9tanta) was conceived and born, but according to the legend, his conception was miraculous and did not need a father, much like other revered heroes of old. In a glass of wine, Dechtire spotted a small worm and saw an opportunity to bring forth a hero. She consumed the worm, and it is unclear if she became pregnant by the god Lugh while in bird form, human form, in a dream or in real life. When it was time for her to give birth, Dechtire gave birth to the child by vomiting it out, remaining a virgin mother. The warriors of Ulster argued about who would raise the miraculous child, but the greatest heroes of the land decided to collectively raise him, each providing their unique skills to Dechtire's son. With Dechtire's exit from the tale, some researchers suggest that her potential to give birth without being impregnated points to a pre-Celtic Mother Goddess who was assimilated into the pantheon when the Celts arrived in Ireland."
