    "text": "Noble children in ancient Ireland were not brought up by their own kin but by unrelated individuals, known as fosterage, a traditional Irish social practice. The fosterage system resulted in the creation of deep bonds between families and territories, where the bond of fosterage was believed to be five times more powerful than that of blood. The children received training, accommodation, and food in accordance with the social status of their family, learning everything from war and druidic arts to householding. Foster siblings grew close with one another, eventually becoming foster brothers and sisters, despite not being related by blood. Amongst Irish myths, the relationships between fosterlings are some of the most intense, with the heart-wrenching combat between the hero C\u00fachulainn and his beloved foster brother Ferdiad being one of the most poignant scenes in all the tales, ending in Ferdiad\u2019s death after three days. The mother's brother, the uncle, was the most common choice for fostering, and C\u00fachulainn himself was fostered in the court of his uncle, King Concobar Mac Nessa. This practice indicates that, despite restrictions placed on women's rights in Irish law, the matrilineal line was still regarded as significant. The bond between the uncle and fosterling was almost as strong as that between parent and child, with the fosterling being responsible for caring for their foster parents in their old age. Therefore, the bonds created by fostering were not merely based on emotions, but also had legal and financial aspects."
