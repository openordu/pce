    "text": "The goddess Macha is known to the Irish. The capital of the ancient Ulster, which was the northernmost of the ancient provinces of Ireland, was named Emain Macha or \"Twins of Macha\" in honor of her. Macha appeared unexpectedly at the door of the human farmer Crunniuc, or perhaps from the Otherworld, to help him cultivate the land and ended up getting pregnant by him. Just like other Fairy Lovers, Macha placed a condition on her spouse which was to keep quiet about their relationship. But at the Assembly of Ulster, Crunniuc saw the king's Horses and was confident that his supernatural wife would outdo them in a race. Unable to not brag about her prowess, he drew the king's attention, and Macha was subsequently compelled to race while heavily pregnant. Despite her pleas to not race, she won the race hands down, proving her mettle but also went into labor, resulting in her demise along with the birth of her twins who were named Fial and Fall. Before her death, Macha proclaimed a curse on the men of the province (see Debility Of The UlsterMEN), declaring that they would become as weak as women; some interpret this as ghost labor pains for five days and four nights, every time an enemy threatened, for nine generations. The above story is about the most prominent goddess named Macha but there are two other goddesses also called Macha which might have been different initially. The wife of one of Ireland's first settlers, Nemed, was Macha, an obscure figure who helped clear the plains of Ireland of the forests that covered it. She envisioned the violence that would plague her country during the preeminent Cattle Raid of Cuailnge (T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge) and died of a broken heart. The first Macha and her more well-known namesake were not goddesses of war: both admonished men's warmongering activities and were a source of trouble for men who participated in battle. Judging from the derivation of her name from words meaning \"earth\" or \"field,\" Macha may also have had a peacemaking side. Nevertheless, several venerable authors describe Macha as a goddess of war; to them, the heads of fallen warriors were \"the masts of Macha,\" a term that also described the plentiful acorns on which half-wild pigs fed. Macha was one of the \"three Morrigna,\" or \"three goddesses of war\" (see M\u00f3rr\u00edgan). Her association with horses may have given rise to this connection, as Irish soldiers went to battle in chariots or mounted on horseback. Though the first two Machas had little to do with war, the third, Macha Mong Rua (Mongruad), or Red-Haired Macha, was a genuine warrior. Some authors consider her to be a form of the goddess, while others see her as an actual historical figure named after the goddess. The Annals of Ireland mention a woman named Macha who was the island's queen in 377 B.C.E. \u00c1ed Ruad, father of Macha, made an agreement with two other kings, D\u00edthorba and Cimb\u00e1eth, equally sharing land ownership and ruling for seven years each. Three criteria were used to evaluate their ability to govern: The land had to be fruitful and acorns abundant for pigs\u2019 fodder, fabrics had to take dyes properly, and finally, the survival of women during childbirth had to be ensured. For a long time, everything went well under shared rule. People were content, well-fed children filled the land, and harvests were bountiful until \u00c1ed perished in a waterfall. Macha, wanting to become his successor, was objected to by her co-rulers. Subsequently, she went to war against them, killed D\u00edthorba and defeated Cimb\u00e1eth before marrying him. Once D\u00edthorba's five sons escaped, disguised as an old Hag, she pursued them by pretending to be a human they tried to rape. Conquering them all, she brought them escorted to Emain Macha. Macha found their penalty for execution unsuitable and ordered instead that they dig the enormous earthworks at Navan Fort. This site contains many ritual sites, including a large artificial mound, a few sacred Wells, and a racecourse. A new museum featuring projected holographs of Emain Macha's ritual past is now available. Due to Macha's connection with Ulster and Ulster Cycle stories, some researchers contend that she was the region's Sovereignty goddess, making her equal to divinities such as \u00c9riu, for whom the island of Ireland is called and Medb, Connacht\u2019s goddess/queen. Macha's significance is a subject of debate as not everyone agrees with the interpretation that is commonly accepted. Some believe that Macha was a goddess from a time before the Celts, who was later included in the social framework of the Celts themselves."
