    "text": "An Irish heroine, Liadan (also spelled L\u00edadan, Liadhain, L\u00eddain), was a bard hailing from the southwestern province of Munster, known for its strong connection to music and song. During a poet\u2019s circuit of the island, another poet by the name of Cuirithir fell in love with her. However, she declined his advances, choosing instead to invite him to visit her in Co. Kerry after she had completed her tour. Unfortunately, Cuirithir never showed up, prompting her entry into a convent. Soon after, Liadan regretted her decision but learned that Cuirithir had already become a priest, making it impossible for them to consummate their love. Although their confessor suggested that they sleep together without giving in to their passion as a proof of their holiness, Cuirithir's subsequent exile for seeking out Liadan led to her death from grief at his praying stone. This Christian tale contains strong Celtic elements, such as the role of women as poets and the lovers' virtue being tested by their chaste sleeping arrangement (similar to the story of Lancelot and Guinevere)."
