    "text": "The mythical Partholonians managed to settle after defeating the monstrous Fomorians, but not through a conventional battle, instead they won through a magical fight in which no blood was spilled. Unfortunately, Parthol\u00f3n, their leader, did not have a happy life in Ireland, as he realized that his wife, Dealgnaid, had slept with their servant Togda while he was away surveying the land. Despite not blaming his wife, but rather himself for leaving her unsatisfied, Parthol\u00f3n struggled to move on. However, he and Dealgnaid managed to have four children, and together they cleared forests and established farms. Sadly, a terrible plague swept through Ireland many years later, killing off all the descendants of Parthol\u00f3n between one Monday and the next in May, except for Tuan Mac Cairill, a Shapeshifting Bard who managed to survive. A fascinating remnant of Parthol\u00f3n would later emerge in the form of an Irish harvest spirit known as Parthan\u00e1n, a being that would steal any grain that was left unthreshed."
