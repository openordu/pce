    "text": "An archaeological term commonly used to describe the deities and religion of the continental Celts and Britain post-Roman conquest is known as the Romano-Celtic. Rather than depicting their gods in human form, the Celts often utilized abstract symbolism, which can prove challenging to understand. However, there are early indications of animal-bodied gods and goddesses. Despite this, the Celts demonstrated a lack of limited artistic skill in how swiftly they adopted the new style of imagery. Within decades of Roman occupation, shrines and temples were found containing figurative sculptures in stone, bronze, and clay depicting deities dressed in typical Roman clothing but adorned with Celtic symbols like the Dog, Hammer, or Antler headpiece. Inscriptions too were a mixed bag; at times, the Roman name was used, while at others, the Celtic name appears. Occasionally we find the usage of both names; Sulis Minerva, who was a healing deity from the hot springs of Bath, being one such example. And then, we see situations where only the Celtic name was inscribed. Nehaleinnia, a crucial goddess for Netherlands and its maritime trade, falls under this category. Besides its cultural influence, the Roman occupation left a notable socio-economic impact on the Celtic inhabitants of Britain as well as the Continent. It is worth noting that the Romans never colonized Ireland, and therefore, there are no Romano-Celtic artifacts from that land. Celtic archaeological finds from the Roman provinces pose a difficulty when it comes to interpretation. The same holds true for literary texts, given that the Celts did not make use of writing, such as Ogham, to document their religion and history. Instead, oral transmission served as their primary means. As a result, we have no native material to compare to that which was written by Romans and other observers. Additionally, the cultural landscape was complicated due to the Romans introducing non-Roman religions, such as the cults of the eastern Asian goddess Cybele and the Persian god Mithras, into Celtic territories through their legions. The Celts were versatile in their spirituality, as seen in Polytheism, and quite possibly embraced new religious notions and opportunities. These historical circumstances cause challenges for scholars when interpreting RomanoCeltic artifacts and texts, and lead to much debate and disagreement regarding their meaning."
