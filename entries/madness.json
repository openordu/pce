    "text": "In Celtic mythology, the theme of madness is prevalent. It appears that in this mythology, individuals experiencing bouts of madness often develop precognitive capabilities or other abilities out of the ordinary. The male figures typically descend into madness due to the horrors of warfare, which is comparable to post-traumatic stress disorder. This state was known as \u201csoldier\u2019s heart\u201d in ancient Ireland, where both the kings Suibhne and Muircertach Mac Erc perished before being fully cured. Meanwhile, the Welsh mythology portrays that the warrior Myrddin, who eventually transforms into the wizard Merlin in the Arthurian material, went mad due to the battle of Arfderydd and fled to Scotland. It was there where he regained his sanity and discovered his prophetic abilities. The link between madness and battle is further reinforced by the presence of Nemain, the war goddess in Irish mythology, who had \"war frenzy\" as her epithet, suggesting that madness was used to their advantage in battles. Every now and then, female characters struggling with madness can also be found, including Mess Buachalla, whose madness was caused by the realization that she committed inadvertent incest with her father, and Mis, who went mad after ingesting her father's blood. However, even in these cases, the reason for such madness can usually be linked to acts of violence or bloodshed."
