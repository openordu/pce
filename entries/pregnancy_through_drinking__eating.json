    "text": "A recurring theme in Celtic mythology is the impregnation of goddesses or heroines through consumption. The typical scenario involves drinking water or wine that has been contaminated by a worm or other insect. A notable example is the tale of the beautiful goddess \u00c9tain, who was transformed into a fly and drowned in a cup of wine, which a princess consumed. Nine months later, \u00c9tain was reborn as a new (but still beautiful) entity. Another myth tells the story of the hero Concobar Mac Nessa, who was born grasping a worm. His mother, the violated scholar Nessa, claimed that the worm was the father, not the Druid who held her captive. As paternity was unclear, Concobar was identified by his mother's surname. Similar motifs can be found in other cultures, such as China, where it was believed that emperors were born through miraculous conception after their mothers ingested atypical foods or beverages. Some suggest that these myths were developed to veil ancient matrilineal inheritance, where names and property were transferred through the mother's lineage."
