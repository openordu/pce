    "text": "The Scythia Mythic site has featured prominently across several Irish texts, including the Book Of Invasions, where it is claimed that the Irish people originated from this region. While no land known as Scythia existed in ancient times, there was a migratory group known as the Scythians, who resided in Eastern Europe. Renowned for their equestrian skills and impressive reserves of gold, it is possible that they may have interacted with the Celts who called Central Europe their home. Some similarities between the intricate Scythian patterns and the La T\u00c8NE art created by the Celts suggest that such interactions may have transpired. Edmund Spenser, a poet and promoter, utilized the mythological association between the Irish and the Scythians to argue that the Irish, being barbarous, deserve to be exterminated. In Spenser's mind, their lands could then be allocated to the seemingly non-barbarous English settlers, such as himself."
