    "text": "Male deity Borvo, also referred to as Bormanus or Bormo, is a god belonging to the Continental Celtic pantheon. In Gaul, he was venerated as the god of healing springs, representing the male counterpart of Sul, who was revered in the singular and in the plural as the SulEVIAE. His iconography displays him as a seated warrior under a horned Serpent. His mother was Sirona and his consort was Damona, also known as Bormana. Among the Romans, Borvo was equated with the healing god Apollo. The meaning behind his name may originate from the term \"boiling,\" a fitting name for a divine being that presides over hot springs."
