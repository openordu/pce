    "text": "Arthurian hero Lancelot, also known as Lancelot of the Lake, Lancelot du lac, Lanceloz and Lanzelot von Arlac, is regarded as the most handsome and courageous knight of the Round Table. His illicit affair with Arthur's queen Guinevere, however, gave rise to a fatal love triangle and became the central storyline in the Arthurian cycle. Scholars have extensively debated the connection between Celtic mythology and the Matter Of Britain, the stories based on King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table, with a general consensus that a relationship exists, though the exact nature of it is still debated. We can find Celtic themes and motifs in the character and deeds of Lancelot, the heroic knight, as well as in the other central figures of the narrative, Arthur and Guinevere. Given that Lancelot is referred to as \"of the lake,\" his background remains complex. Some scholars have linked him to the mysterious Lady Of The Lake, possibly inferring that he was of the Fairy people. However, several texts suggest that the Lady was his foster mother and that his father was French king Ban of Benoic. Records of Ban are limited, but alternative tales propose that Lancelot was the son of King Pant of Genewis and Clarine, who was abducted by the Lady of the Lake while nursing her husband's wounds from battle. Lancelot later discovered the truth of his lineage and was drawn to Camelot by the fame of the great king and his stunning queen. Lancelot and Guinevere were drawn to each other from the beginning, but in the interest of her virtue and the harmony of the court, both restrained their desire. When Guinevere spent a night with Lancelot in the forest, the noble knight placed a sword between them to prevent succumbing to temptation. Arthur later found them sleeping virtuously beside each other and kept the sword with him, so the couple knew they were observed. Guinevere was left heartbroken when Lancelot departed the court to seek glory in battle. A similar story occurs in the Irish tale of Gr\u00e1inne and Diarmait, but Gr\u00e1inne was a more straightforward and sexually demanding partner. In the story of The Knight of the Cart as told by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, Lancelot pursued Guinevere when she was kidnapped by the giant or king Meleagant. Traveling alongside a Dwarf carrying a cart of condemned prisoners, Lancelot joined the criminals when told he would only see his beloved again in that manner. When he encountered two bridges leading to Meleagant's castle, he was given a choice: one was smooth and straight but went beneath the moat, while the other was a sword blade over the water. Lancelot, in his desperation to find Guinevere, wounded himself gravely by taking a shorter route. Upon locating the queen in a bedroom where the seneschal Kay was sleeping wounded, Lancelot bled his way into her bed. When bloodstains were discovered on Guinevere\u2019s sheets the following day, Kay was wrongfully accused of seducing her, forcing Lancelot to fight for his friend\u2019s honour. After Guinevere's return to Camelot, she became both Lancelot's mistress and the land's queen. Due to his fall from grace, Lancelot couldn't achieve his goal when he went on the quest for the sacred Grail. The affair was kept secret in the court, and Lancelot performed many courageous deeds in Guinevere\u2019s name. He released the numerous knights held captive in the Perilous Valley, which is part of the forest of Broc\u00e9liande where Morgan, king Arthur\u2019s half-sister and a sorceress, had cast her spell. Morgan made certain that any knight who had ever wronged a woman would be trapped by her magic, seeing the trees as massive battlements guarded by fire-breathing dragons because of her betrayal. Many knights, including the apparently virtuous Gawain, were trapped there until Lancelot, ever loyal to his queen and lover, liberated them. Sadly, the commencement of their affair also led to the downfall of Camelot. Lancelot was not to be blamed, nor the hopelessly infatuated queen, for Arthur\u2019s own past deeds shattered his utopian kingdom. Guinevere was condemned for treason and sentenced to death by fire, but Lancelot saved her just as her pyre was about to be lit, in the commotion murdering his best friend, the righteous knight Gareth. Conceived upon Morgause, Arthur's own illegitimate son, Mordred, initiated an attack on Camelot that resulted in the demise of all of the heroes apart from Arthur, who was whisked away by the mysterious Lady of the Lake, possibly to reappear sometime in the future as Britain's \"once and future king.\" As per certain sources, Lancelot perished during this final battle, whereas others claim that he went on to become a saintly hermit in his castle, while his cherished Guinevere took up residence in a convent. The Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot love triangle is reminiscent of two other Celtic romances: one hailing from Ireland, which is about the heroic leader Fionn Mac Cumhaill, his young follower Diarmait, and the lady Gr\u00e1inne; the other from Cornwall involving the ageing king Mark, the handsome knight Tristan, and his pre-destined lover Iseult. Despite certain similarities, there are notable differences between the stories. The self-assertive Gr\u00e1inne set a Geis, or sacred vow, upon Diarmait that he must abduct her and later provoked him into sleeping with her, while Guinevere was comparatively hesitant in voicing her desire for Lancelot; some believe that her reluctance was influenced by Christianity. In contrast to the Arthurian material, the Tristan and Iseult story does not lack magical motifs. After drinking a magic potion intended for the bride to share with King Mark on her wedding night, the couple became hopelessly in love with each other. Enchanted by the potion, the couple fought unsuccessfully against their love; Iseult's struggles mirror those experienced by Guinevere in preserving her virtue. The resemblance between the three stories, which all hail from various Celtic lands, has led scholars to suggest that they are originally derived from a myth in which the goddess of Sovereignty transfers her love to a young and new king, thus authorizing his sovereignty. Selected by the goddess-queen as her next lover, Lancelot, together with his fellow figures Tristan and Diarmait, does not exhibit traits of a story of dynastic change. While the goddess's choice may have indicated that a new king was to be installed, three distinct Celtic cultures elaborated their own vivid human tales which deviate from this mythological outline. In some literary works, particularly, Lancelot is portrayed as the Lady of the Lake's lover and also, by her, the father of the noteworthy knight Galahad. In other renditions, it was Elaine of Corbenic, his accidental lover, through whom he begot Galahad, mistakenly believing in his inebriated state that he was sleeping with his beloved Guinevere. Some of the narratives surrounding King Arthur do not paint Lancelot as Guinevere's lover but as an unwavering servant of the king. Consequently, scholars have inferred that the love triangle was a recent evolution of the myth."
