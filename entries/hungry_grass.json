    "text": "The Irish folkloric site, known as the \"hungry grass,\" reveals the impact of significant historical events on folklore. The Irish Famine, or An Gorta M\u00f3r, was a result of English occupation, which denied Irish farmers the right to own land and forced them to live as impoverished tenants. The arrival of the potato from South America allowed even small patches of land to support farming families, but monoculture made them vulnerable to famine. In 1848-50, an airborne fungus caused the potatoes to turn into black slime after harvesting, leading to the starvation of millions of tenant farmers. Despite the availability of other food sources such as cattle, most livestock belonged to landlords, exacerbating the crisis. The bitterness and political strife caused by Ireland's food exports during the famine years had long-lasting effects. Though the famine ended within a decade, its impact continued for years, with the country's population still recovering. While the actual morbidity figures are unknown due to poor record-keeping, it is estimated that between one and one-and-a-half million people died from starvation and disease, while a similar number were forced to emigrate. Legend has it that the Great Famine of Ireland gave birth to the tragic myth of the hungry grass. Soil patches that were present during the Famine, are said to be imbued with remembrances of the event, and whoever happens to step on them is consumed with a burning hunger so intense that it leads to death, despite having their fill. There are multiple claims regarding the growth of the hungry grass; some believe it springs up where people died of hunger, be it in hovels or on the side of the road, whereas others speculate it emerges over the unmarked graves of Famine victims. Although animals are not as severely affected by the hungry grass as humans, there are accounts of cattle that have mysteriously passed away after consuming it."
