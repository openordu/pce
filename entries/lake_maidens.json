    "text": "Celtic mythology depicts lake maidens as folkloric characters. These beings are said to reside in the lakes, which are believed to be entrances to the Otherworld in Celtic lands. The fairy women possess enchanted palaces beneath the waters, which can sometimes be witnessed from the shore. The lake maidens occasionally appear as Swan Maidens and are known to be great wives for humans; however, they are difficult to catch. To capture a lake maiden, one must steal something from her. This could be her robe of feathers when she appears as a swan or another object, such as her comb. Once a maid has been caught, she becomes an industrious and satisfying wife. But she places certain taboos on her husband's conduct. Restrictions such as not being surprised by anything one's child does, like \u00c1ine's of Lough Gur husband or taking Sunday off, like Melusine's husband, are imposed by these maidens. Nelferch, a Welsh lake maiden, enforced that her man should not strike her without reason, and set a threshold of only three mistakes. With the exception of her husband's propensity to tap her for attention, she lived happily with him. However, after tapping her the third time, Nelferch disappeared, leaving her husband to speculate. The lake maidens instantaneously return to their lake homes, sometimes taking their children and, at times, abandoning them as orphans."
