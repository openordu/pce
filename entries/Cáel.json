    "text": "A hero of the Fianna in Ireland was C\u00e1el (or Caol), who became known for his legendary romance with Cr\u00e9d. C\u00e1el, a slender hero, was able to capture the heart of Cr\u00e9d by reciting praise-poetry to her. Cr\u00e9d had challenged the Bards of Ireland to create a poem about her palace. No man had ever entered into it, and the prize at stake was her own hand. C\u00e1el utilized the telepathic abilities taught in his poetry training to craft the winning verse. However, C\u00e1el was tragically killed in battle, leaving Cr\u00e9d to face overwhelming sorrow. Overcome with grief, Cr\u00e9d climbed into C\u00e1el's burial mound, lying beside him one last time before passing away as well, consumed by sorrow."
