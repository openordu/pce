    "text": "Two colors were commonly associated with Fairyland or the Otherworld, green and red. Trooping fairies were typically linked with the color red, while solitary fairies were more closely associated with green. The color red held symbolic significance and was often considered unlucky, particularly if worn on clothing or scarves by humans. In fact, women dressed in red petticoats were avoided in the west of Ireland until very recently. Red hair or hide was also considered particularly ominous and tied to fairy origin. For instance, fairy cattle were believed to be white with red ears, while a dog or cat born with this coloring was thought to have fairy blood or be a Changeling. People with red hair were also believed to have a connection to fairy blood and were subject to many superstitions. It was believed to bring bad luck to meet a red-haired woman first thing in the morning or to pass a person dressed in red in the morning or when starting a project. Animals with red ears were also thought to be able to predict or possibly bring on difficulties."
