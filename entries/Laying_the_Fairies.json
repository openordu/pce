    "text": "The concept of Fairies in folklore includes a peculiar way of getting rid of them. It involves offering them something to make them leave. Brownies, fairies who often assisted humans, were believed to do so for their own motives, without expecting any material gain such as money or apparel. On occasions where they were given clothing, some immediately vanished, while others left only after receiving hand-knit miniature sweaters. When this type of ill-advised generosity was used to drive them away, it was said that the fairies had been \"laid\" by their former benefactor."
