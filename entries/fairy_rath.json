    "text": "Circular walls of earth known as raths or Hillforts were built by the Celts for protection of their hilltop palaces. These walls can still be seen in various places across ancient Celtic territories. Despite the passage of time, many raths have survived, never having been leveled by farmers or built upon by those who live in those areas. According to folklore, such sites were believed to be openings to Fairyland and thus development was strictly forbidden. A similar belief was held towards Fairy Trees and Fairy Mounds. Numerous of Ireland\u2019s valuable ancient monuments still exist today since people feared the punishment that meddling with anything belonging to the fairies could bring. These beliefs may be perceived as superstitious but they have excellently served the purpose of preserving the past."
