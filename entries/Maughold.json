    "text": "A legendary figure in Manx folklore is Maughold, also known as St. Maughold or Machutus. According to early Christian legend on the Isle of Man, Maughold was converted by St. Patrick and was later padlocked inside a small boat that was set to sail out to sea. Despite being rescued, the lock could not be opened because the key was thrown overboard and eaten by a fish. It was only many years later when Maughold ate a fish containing the long-lost key that the lock could finally be opened, and he went on to become the bishop of the island. The story of Maughold incorporates folkloric tropes and celebrates his feast at the old Celtic harvest holiday of Lughnasa, suggesting that this Christian legend may have assimilated an earlier pagan one."
