    "text": "The Irish hero known as Cailitin, sometimes spelled as Calatin or Calat\u00edn, was a Druid warrior composed of one man and his 27 identical sons, all of whom were deficient in one left hand and one right foot. Having completed his education in sorcery in Scotland, the Cailitin clan was hired by the great queen Medb to fight against C\u00fachulainn, the renowned hero, who ultimately managed to defeat every member of the Cailitin group. Despite this loss, the druid's wife swiftly gave birth to two sets of dreadful triplets, one group each of daughters and sons. Medb trained the battle-crow Badb, who was among the daughters, to become a skilled wizard, ultimately utilizing her powers to cause C\u00fachulainn's demise. The one-eyed daughters, in conjunction with C\u00fachulainn's rival Lugaidh mac Con R\u00f3, contributed to the hero's downfall."
