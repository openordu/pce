    "text": "Scholars of religion distinguish between the monotheistic and polytheistic worldviews, with the former holding that divinity is singular and the latter maintaining that it exists in plurality. However, this separation does not capture the intricacies of the topic. Monotheism implicitly includes dualism as whatever is not considered \"god\" is relegated to \"not-god.\" Thus, monotheistic religions typically develop a theology that incorporates evil. Additionally, monotheism often associates the divine with something beyond or outside of this world, which diminishes the sanctity of nature as it is a creation of god rather than being a god itself. Furthermore, all monotheistic religions are based on the male image of divinity, with none excluding a male god while simultaneously dismissing a female image of the divine. The three most influential monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, originated in a relatively small region in the eastern Mediterranean and are considered desert religions that use imagery akin to that geographical land. Polytheism, on the other hand, is the belief in multiple divinities and has been the dominant religious system throughout most of the world's history. Polytheism is generally less dualistic than monotheism, despite the existence of dualistic cults such as the Manichaeism of Persia. More commonly, evil is viewed as a part of the natural cycle that is less comprehensible and frightful. In this view, death is not the opposite of life, but is instead a natural part of it. The fear of death is not absent in polytheistic cultures, nor is the mourning for the deceased diminished. However, death is not seen as an unnatural occurrence. The Celts were exceedingly polytheistic, with over 200 gods and goddesses recorded, although not many were commonly known in more than one location. It is possible that the number of deities was fewer if each god was known by many titles, much like the many titles given to the second person of the Christian trinity, \u201cJesus,\u201d \u201cLord,\u201d \u201cChrist,\u201d \u201cSavior,\u201d \u201cSon of Man,\u201d and more. It can be challenging to ascertain whether the same image appearing in various locations represents different regional embodiments of the same divine power or different names for the same god. The Celts did not have a hierarchical pantheon or a predetermined sequence of gods and goddesses. Instead, they appeared to believe that divinity and place were intricately related and that place, in turn, connected to people. The Irish term Tuath referred to both a tribe of people and to the place where they resided. Every region had its deity, representing the land, its sovereignty, and the people residing and connected to it. This idea is most powerfully expressed through the goddesses of the Irish land, but it appears to be present across numerous other Celtic regions where different divinities represent various natural sites, such as Springs, Rivers, river sources, lakeshores, and other locations. Scholars have posited that the Celtic people's veneration of their deities associated with specific locations contributed to a profound appreciation and affection for the natural world. This adoration is exemplified in the literature and traditions of Celtic societies, where rituals were performed in accordance with seasonal changes, signs were interpreted from natural occurrences such as bird flight, and lore was crafted to connect myth and place. Some suggest that Celtic culture implied monism, characterizing a mutual connection between all of nature that could be embodied in a single entity, although no hierarchy rendering a particular god superior was ever documented. As such, the Christianization of the Celtic regions necessitated the integration and adjustment to a new system of beliefs."
