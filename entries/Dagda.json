    "text": "The Irish god known as Dagda (also known as Daghdha, Dagdae, Dagda M\u00f3r, Cera, and Samildanach) was believed to be a multi-talented deity. He was known as \"the good god,\" not because he was morally good, but because he was proficient in everything. While other gods of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann specialized in specific areas, Dagda was an artisan, diviner, husbandman, warrior, and wise king. He was also a benevolent god of abundance and fertility. He possessed a magical Cauldron that never ran out, a massive mallet (clearly imbued with phallic meaning), which had to be transported on a cart, and two enchanted Pigs that could be consumed repeatedly and yet still revive themselves. Dagda also owned an orchard that was always overflowing with fruit, regardless of the season. Thus, Dagda was a symbol of not only masculine excellence but also the fertility of the Earth itself. Despite his virtues, Dagda was not handsome and was often depicted in a comical fashion. He dragged his oversized mallet while wearing a short tunic that left his private parts exposed, and he unapologetically indulged in his immense appetites. Nonetheless, he was always helpful and was considered a mighty force of fertility that could not be ignored. He was known by several names that emphasized his benevolence, such as Eochaid Ollathair (\"father of all\") and Ruad Rofhessa (\"lord of great knowledge\"). Some scholars suggest that he may be connected to the enigmatic god Crom Cruach due to his untranslated title Crom-eocha. Dagda was also recognized as one of the multivalent gods known as the Samiladanach, or \"many-skilled man.\" The deity known as the Dagda was known for his many partners among the goddesses of Ireland, and was particularly captivated by the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan, who had black wings like a crow. At the River Unshin in Connacht, he saw her standing with one foot on each bank while she washed the clothes of those about to meet their end in the forthcoming battle. When the Dagda witnessed her at the stream, he was immediately consumed with lust and the two had intercourse. She found the experience so enjoyable that she agreed to lend her support to the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann in the battle at Mag Tuired against their adversaries, a tribe of monstrous beings known as the Fomorians. As the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann fought, the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan sang magical chants on the sidelines in support, ultimately driving the Fomorians out of Ireland. The Dagda was also known to be the consort of B\u00f3and, a fertility goddess. They had many offspring, including Brigit, the goddess of inspiration, and Aonghus\u00f3g, the god of poetry and beauty; their children represented a figurative blending of abundance and poetry. The Dagda was also the father of other deities such as Midir, the Fairy king, and Bodb Derg, a powerful magician. The Dagda was closely associated with Br\u00fa Na B\u00f3inne, the expansive ceremonial earthworks located along the Boyne river, which was named after B\u00f3and. This site later became the home of Aonghus. Because the Dagda secretly consorted with B\u00f3and, who was married to the god Nechtan at the time, he is sometimes referred to as the foster father of Aonghus. When Aonghus wished to marry, the Dagda cleared twelve large plains overnight to provide the necessary bride-price. \u00c1ed Minbhrec was one of the many children of the Dagda. However, his life was cut short when he was killed by Corgenn in a fit of jealousy. Despite his power, the Dagda was unable to bring his beloved son back to life. In an attempt to bring justice for \u00c1ed Minbhrec, the Dagda placed a sacred vow, known as a Geis, upon Corgenn. The Geis forced Corgenn to carry \u00c1ed Minbhrec's body on his back until he found a stone of equal size and weight to the deceased. Only then would Corgenn be able to rest. With the weight of the body on his back, Corgenn travelled throughout Ireland until he finally found a resting place for \u00c1ed Minbhrec's remains: the ancient Hillfort of Grian\u00e1n Aileach in County Donegal. Although the Dagda was a force of fertility that could not truly be killed, it was said that he died during the second battle of Mag Tuired. Even though the Dagda fought bravely and heroically, he was killed by Cethlion, the wife of Balor, the Fomorian king. Despite his death, the Dagda continued to reign from the Otherworld, where he enjoyed his four magnificent palaces and indulged himself with the magically abundant cauldron and ever-fruitful orchard."
