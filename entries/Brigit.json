    "text": "An Irish goddess by the name of Brigit (also known as Bride, Brigid, Brighid, Brid, Bridget, and Briid) is a significant figure with two distinct personas: the goddess Brigit and Brigit of Kildare, an early Christian saint who died approximately in 525 CE. Though some fervent believers acknowledge the implausible accumulation of legends surrounding the life of Brigit of Kildare, a woman whose historicity remains questionable, it is still debated whether the latter is a Christianized version of the former. While it is likely that a brilliant abbess named after a Celtic goddess lived in Kildare, there is no evidence that she traveled through time to serve as a midwife during Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, or that she removed her eyes to avoid marriage only to restore them with no loss of sight, or even that she used sunbeams to hang her wet mantle. Nevertheless, Brigit the saint, who was made a bishop accidentally by a cleric who was inebriated by a god, possesses much of the power and magic depicted earlier by the goddess. As a goddess, Brigit is unique among the Celts in that she appears in many locations. Due to the intensely place-based nature of Celtic gods, the pan-Celtic manifestation of this figure is noteworthy, leading some to believe that the name variants refer to the same deity. Brigit, as an Irish goddess, held sway over transformation of all kinds: she was known for her expertise in poetry, smithcraft, and healing. Additionally, she was associated with fire and cattle, and was the daughter of the Dagda, the god of fertility; as the mother of Ruad\u00e1n, she invented Keening to mourn his death. Brigit is often referred to as a triple goddess in certain texts or as one of three goddesses with her name, each of whom presides over smithcraft, healing, and poetry. This type of triplication is common in Celtic mythology and is used to highlight a figure's divine power. It is uncertain whether Brigh Ambui mentioned in the ancient Irish law text titled Senchas M\u00f3r is the same goddess, particularly as there are other sections of the text that feature mythical male figures. The famed Brehon or judge Briathra Brighi, who was referred to as the \"female author of the men of Ireland,\" derived her name from Brigh Ambui, and the text suggests that it was frequent to call female judges \"Brigit.\" The issue of women's rights as lawyers or protected groups under the law remains unclear. Brigh Ambui, on the other hand, is listed third on the Senchas M\u00f3r's list of significant figures in the Irish law lineage. Some scholars maintain the belief that an all-female priesthood of Brigit existed, and they suggest that males were banned from her sanctuary. She was likely viewed as a provider of civilization, in the same vein as other Indo-European hearth goddesses such as Vesta and Hestia, who established the social contract from their position in the heart and hearth of each household. The mythical Brigit was not viewed as a virgin in Ireland; in fact, she was believed to be the wife of Bres mac Elatha, one of Ireland's prominent early kings, and gave birth to their child, Ruad\u00e1n. Her feast day, known as Imbolc, falls on February 1st and is observed even today in Ireland. In the southeast corner of Ireland, Leinster, lies the special region of St. Brigit, who is also associated with the historical home of the saint who shares her name. Even today, St. Brigit is honored in Kildare, the ancient seat of her abbey. While very little can be verified regarding her life, legends have stepped in to flesh out the details. St. Brigit is said to have been born of a Christian slave mother and a pagan Celtic King. Miracles surrounded her birth as light poured from the child, and the Druids of the court named her after the panCeltic goddess mentioned earlier. Once grown, she refused marriage and even went so far as to pull out her own eyes to make herself too ugly for suitors. But she then healed herself and began to search for a suitable location to establish her convent. Through deception, she managed to secure land belonging to a local king at Kildare, which became one of ancient Ireland\u2019s major religious centers. The name Kildare is said to combine the terms \u2018kil\u2019 (church), and \u2018dar\u2019 (oak, a tree sacred to the druids), embodying two of Ireland\u2019s major spiritual traditions. At Kildare, St. Brigit served as both abbess and bishop, having been inadvertently conferred holy orders by St. Mel who overwhelmed with excitement went ahead to bless the abbess. In 1184, the historian Giraldus Cambrensis reported that the nuns had kept an undying flame burning to St. Brigit for nearly five centuries. This tradition was akin to the fire rituals of Sul and Bath, and had a foundation in Celtic religion. The miraculous flame produced no ash and burned continuously for years until Giraldus reported it. Soon after that, the flame was extinguished and the nuns dispersed. However, the Brigidine sisters returned to Kildare in 1994 and relit the flame, honoring St. Brigit to this day. Pilgrims from around the world gather annually on Imbolc to witness the rekindling of the fire in the ancient temple, which was discovered during restoration work in the 1980s on the grounds of the Protestant cathedral in Kildare. Alongside the rekindling ceremony, respectful vigils are held at the Well of Brigit, in addition to celebration of other ceremonial, artistic and social-justice events, all of which make up L\u00e1 F\u00e9ile Bhride or the feast of Bridget. The Irish seem to associate goddess and saint even more strongly outside of Kildare, where Imbolc has been celebrated and embraced through various traditions of springtime greeting even into the late 20th century. February 1st, the festival of Brigit the goddess, to this day continues to be celebrated as the feast of Brigit the saint. Although in most lands, old folkways which have pre-Christian roots have died away, some traditions like the Biddy Boy processions in Co. Kerry and the crios bridghe (\u201cBrigit girdle\u201d) in Co. Galway have been recently revived. There are now many workshops offered in constructing the four-armed rush Brigit cross and the rush poppet called the Br\u00edde\u00f3g (little Brigit), while around the world, Christians and neopagans alike pay tribute to Brigit in various forms, including on-line societies of Brigit."
