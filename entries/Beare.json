    "text": "In the province of Munster, at the far southwest of Ireland, a thin peninsula that is rich in both antiquities and legend stretches out to the sea. This land is called Beare (Bheara) peninsula, named after the Irish goddess Beare (also known as Bera, B\u00e9irre, or Mom\u00e9a). Although little legend remains about Beare, it is said that she was a Spanish princess. More significant in mythology was the Cailleach Bh\u00e9irre, an ancient land goddess of the pre-Celtic people, also known as the Hag of Beare. Even today, she is associated with the area and she can be seen in the shape of a boulder, looking towards the sea on the north side of the peninsula. At times, her name is mutated making it Mom\u00e9a."
