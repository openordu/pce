    "text": "Celtic philosophy and spirituality were not written down or confined by text. Instead, they were conveyed through oral traditions, poetry, art, and ritual. Therefore, piecing together Celtic beliefs for scholars is a complex process based on widely separated archaeological and textual evidence. The study of Celtic religion becomes even more complicated with most texts originating from Ireland, a country with few graven images, while most images come from the Continent, where only a few Celtic texts are known. Also, the comparison of text and image is difficult because people living in these areas had different indigenous beliefs, which might have had a varying effect on Celtic life. Furthermore, Celtic Polytheism is astonishing, and experts hardly find Celtic divinities in any text or inscription more than once. As a result, we cannot ascertain whether the Celts had a vision of ultimate divinity, with multiple forms being only aspects, or whether there was no such abstract concept of divinity. Finally, many Celtic texts were written by Christian monks, whose potential to alter texts to match their own beliefs leaves doubts. Despite all these complications, scholars have attempted to identify common threads among Celtic religious texts and artifacts. They explain that the Celtic worldview relies on the concept of an Otherworld, where humans have temporary access to a land of perfect yet somewhat infertile beauty. Access to the Otherworld, believed by the Celts to exist alongside our own, was limited to certain times of the year such as Beltane and Samhain, or specific locations such as bogs and islands. The inhabitants of the Otherworld were thought to be able to cross into our world with greater ease than we could enter theirs, and as such, were known to conduct raids to acquire desired goods and people. Musicians and bards often journeyed to the Otherworld, from which they returned with lovely songs and poems. The Celts had a more balanced perspective on the world, choosing to see it in terms of harmony rather than opposition between male and female, summer and winter, and night and day. The goddess of Sovereignty represented prosperity and abundance, though she also had a darker aspect through which she brought destruction and death. The human king was her partner and was bound by sacred vows to maintain the fertility of the land and safeguard the people. The Celt's religion, despite its nomadic origins, was firmly rooted in locality, with a multitude of sacred names for springs, hills, rivers, and promontories. It is unclear whether this connection to the land was due to contact with settled groups, however, the belief that place and people are intimately linked points to a strong sense of the sanctity of the earth."
