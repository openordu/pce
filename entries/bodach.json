    "text": "A Scottish figure believed to exist in folklore is the bodach (carle). In the Highland region, this folkloric figure could manifest in two forms \u2014 either as a harmless prankster, or as the Bodach Glas or Dark Gray Man, a male Banshee that would appear just before an imminent death. The term bodach is derived from its portrayal as a frail elderly man that made invitations or stared into windows during night-time hours. Even though somewhat intimidating, the bodach was not considered to be significantly dangerous. Another Highland Fairy was the Bodach \u00e1 Chipein, or the \u201cOld Man with the Peg\u201d. Known to be friendly and amiable, it would observe humans while they engaged in their routine activities, shedding tears every time mourners passed by. Occasionally, the term is found in Ireland, indicating the same figure."
