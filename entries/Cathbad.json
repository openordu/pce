    "text": "A powerful Druid from the court of King Concobar Mac Nessa, Cathbad was a significant figure in the Ulster Cycle. He had his sights set on Assa, a studious maiden, and in his pursuit of her, destroyed the lives of her tutors. As a result, Assa became a warrior known as Nessa. Despite her newfound strength, Cathbad still managed to rape her when he caught her off guard and held her captive as a concubine. However, Nessa outsmarted Cathbad. Through her ability to read omens, she discovered that swallowing a Worm found floating in her wine would lead to her conceiving a hero. And so it was that she bore the king Concobar Mac Nessa. Cathbad later became the mentor of C\u00fachulainn, Concobar\u2019s hero, and the father of Findch\u00f3em, who also used Nessa\u2019s method of conceiving. Cathbad also appeared in the romantic tale of Deirdre, who he prophesied would bring sorrow to Ulster before her birth."
