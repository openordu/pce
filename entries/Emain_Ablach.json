    "text": "Emain Ablach, also known as Eamhain or Emhain and Abhlach, is a site of Irish mythology. One of the most remarkable Celtic beliefs about the Otherworld was related to Emain Albach, or the Isle of Apples, a wonderful place where summer never ends, and the handsome inhabitants spend their days dancing under the sun. Bran mac Febail was drawn to Emain Albach by a dream-woman who gave him a silver branch that reminded him of how lovely she was. He eventually arrived at the place where he found the woman and spent countless years with her, but he missed his homeland, so he had to leave. Niamh of the Golden Hair, Bran's lover, reluctantly allowed him to leave, along with the other visitors. One of the sailors was so moved when they reached the shores of Ireland that he jumped off the ship. However, time in the Otherworld passes more slowly than on earth, so he aged and turned to dust within an instant due to the earth's time. Bran, who was unable to make a choice between death and exile, left again, and he is presumed to continue sailing between our world and the Otherworld. Emain Albach was believed to be somewhere off the coast of Scotland or Ireland, like many seagirt green Islands from which one could enter the Otherworld. Its capital was Cruith\u00edn na Cuan, and its king was Manann\u00e1n Mac Lir, the Irish god of the sea, after whom the Isle of Man was named. At times, that real island was also referred to as Emain Albach. No introduction or personal reference is provided in the text. It suggests that Avalon, the Arthurian Otherworld, could be derived from a name."
