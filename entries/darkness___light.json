    "text": "Cosmological ideas about the interplay of darkness and light existed among the Celts. The Celts viewed dusk as the beginning of the day, which culminated in evening, as opposed to the way we interpret it today. Additionally, they believed the year began with autumn and concluded in summer. As such, Celtic holidays took place on what we would consider the night before the actual feast day. An example of this is the celebration of Hallowe\u2019en on October 31, which marks the precursor of Samhain on November 1. While we have no records of any Celtic myths of creation, the pattern of commemoration often suggests a pre-existing, more enigmatic world before our current sunlit one. This relates to the idea of the Otherworld, a notion of a separate but linked realm from which the items in our world derive their authority. The Celts did not perceive light and darkness as enemies, unlike the Persian belief of Manichaeism. Instead, according to the Celts, they were complementary components of a solitary entity."
