    "text": "A significant spiritual symbol for the Celts was the hearth, the center of the home which they associated with the Otherworld. It was a liminal space, residing at the border between this world and that of the spirits. The hearth often served as the cooking fire and provided heat for the home, decorated with divine symbols like those on the ram's-head andirons discovered in Gaul. Early archaeological sites emphasize the importance of the hearth, as it was a place where sacrifices to the family's ancestors were made. Fairies and ghosts were attracted to the hearth, especially on pivotal days such as Samhain, the beginning of winter on November 1. On that night, ghosts of the deceased would often be seen warming themselves by the hearth-fire or sitting in their usual spot calmly knitting or smoking."
