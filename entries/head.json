    "text": "The ancient Celtic world is replete with references to the head, both in literature and sculpture. Scholars used to refer to the \"cult of the head\" in early Celtic cultures, but this terminology has since fallen out of academic favor. Archaeologists have discovered many examples of sculptured heads dating back to the Urnfield period, as well as inhuman heads with three faces. There are even sculptures that combine the head with the phallus. Heads featuring the likeness of sacred animals were also considered significant in Celtic religion. The head, deemed sacred across the entire Celtic region, is the most important and commonly depicted symbol in Celtic religious contexts. Myths and rituals which emphasize the importance of the head are plentiful across the Celtic world. For instance, the Welsh hero Bran The Blessed's speaking head, which continued speaking for years after his death, was of great importance. The Irish warrior Conaire M\u00f3r's head was also known for it's posthumous speech. The head of musician and warrior Donn B\u00f3 produced a piercing melody at a post-battle feast, reducing all to tears. These speaking or singing severed heads are believed to have oracular powers and could be consulted for divination. In ancient folklore, a common mythological motif was the ability of Giants to reattach their severed heads and continue functioning normally. This supernatural power necessitated that their enemies keep their head and body separated until both were numbed with cold, ensuring they were no longer a threat to their opponents. The decapitated head was also imbued with magical properties in some stories, capable of acting autonomously as a weapon to retaliate against the warrior who separated it from the body. These traditions are reminiscent of ancient Celtic practices, in which warriors would sever and display the heads of their vanquished foes, as the head was believed to be the essence of their personality, much like the heart in contemporary American culture. Roman historian Livy recounted how the Celtic Boii warriors would enshrine the head of their defeated chief in a temple, and lesser foes' heads were suspended from the bridles of their conquerors' horses or affixed onto their homes as a menacing spectacle. Diodorus Siculus, the Greek historian, similarly documented how warriors would detach the heads of their adversaries in war, then nail or strap them onto houses and horses' bridles. While Poseidonius wrote about his revulsion at seeing numerous heads displayed outside a Celtic chieftain's home, he admitted that he became acclimatized to the horror over time. The heads of distinguished foes were preserved in cedarwood boxes as trophies, and proudly exhibited to recount heroic feats. These accounts are reflected in Irish myth, which glorifies the warrior C\u00fachulainn, who returns from battle holding nine heads on one hand and ten on the other. The myth also alleges that upon the hero's death, his wife Emer accepted the heads of his ten killers. \u201cThe masts of Macha\u201d were the heads of the defeated foes, a phrase that symbolized the acorns that PIGs fed on. In other Irish texts, it is mentioned that warriors would extract the brains of their defeated enemies and mix them with lime to make a \u201cbrain ball\u201d which they could use as a weapon or display as a trophy. Meisceadhra\u2019s brain ball, the hero, was hurled at king Concobar Mac Nessa, his murderer, lodging in Concobar's skull, eventually resulting in his death. There is evidence that links the Celts' esteem for the head to that of Water. Skulls and metal replicas of heads have been found in sacred sources and wells. The respect given to the \u201cheads\u201d of Rivers, such as the round pool at the Shannon River's source, combines these two symbolic meanings into one."
