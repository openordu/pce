    "text": "A Scottish mythological character known as \"tarans\" was believed to be the spirit of unbaptized infants. These spirits were encountered in desolate areas, lamenting their inability to ascend to heaven. The explanation behind this belief seems to incorporate both Celtic and Christian beliefs regarding the afterlife, entwining the Otherworld with the Christian concept of Limbo, which is a place for souls that are not sanctified but remain unsullied and spend an eternal period there."
