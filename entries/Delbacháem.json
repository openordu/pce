    "text": "The story of Delbach\u00e1em, an Irish goddess or heroine, narrates her plight as a prisoner in a lofty tower, held captive by her mother, the formidable Warrior Woman named Coinchenn. It was said that the curse placed on Coinchenn prophesied her death if her daughter were to wed. Coinchenn thwarted all suitors by challenging them to battle, successfully defeating them all, until Art mac Cuinn, the king of Tara, emerged as a victor. Art had been placed under a Geis by his stepmother, Fairy B\u00e9 Chuma, who was headstrong and licentious. The Geis forbade Art from eating any food until he had abducted Delbach\u00e1em from her enchanted island. B\u00e9 Chuma, who was envious of Delbach\u00e1em's beauty, plotted to kill them both, having been spurned by Art and rejected by Delbach\u00e1em under the guise of her own beauty. Art, aided by mysterious and attractive women, discovered a way to save Delbach\u00e1em and rid her of her mother once and for all, fulfilling the prophecy of Coinchenn's demise. B\u00e9 Chuma was subsequently banished from Tara by Art."
