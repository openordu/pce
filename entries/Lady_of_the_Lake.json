    "text": "Arthurian legend tells us the story of the Lady of the Lake, a heroine that is often referred to as Nimue or Morgause. Although she is distinct from these characters, the Lady is the one who bestowed upon Arthur the magical sword known as Excalibur, thus playing a crucial role in the legend of King Arthur. The Lady is described as a Fairy, a semi-divine being that lived in a world other than ours, the Celtic Otherworld, which was specifically called the Land of Women or Tir Na Mban. The Lady resided on a mysterious lake surrounded by her maiden servants. She captured Lancelot and raised him to be her protector, which earned him the nickname of Lancelot of the Lake. According to some sources, Lancelot was also the Lady's lover, and they had a son, the pure knight known as Galahad. In later texts, the Fairy Queen's character was downgraded to a mere sorceress who used illusions to keep people away from her land, but her power in the Arthurian legends remained unflinching. She protected Arthur throughout his life, and when he died, he returned Excalibur to the Lady by throwing it into the lake's depths. The Lady then took the wounded king away with her, and no one knows where he went. According to some scholars, the Lady's connection to Arthur is similar to that of the Irish goddess M\u00f3rr\u00edgan and the hero C\u00fachulainn."
