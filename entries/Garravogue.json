    "text": "A figure in Irish folklore known as Garravogue (also spelled Carravogue, Garbh\u00f3g, Ghearag\u00e1in, Garrawog, and Garragh-Maw) is an intriguing character. Two hag-like beings of similar names appear in Irish oral folklore and may have descended from the ancient goddess known as the Cailleach. In Co. Sligo, it is said that the River Garravogue was named after a witch who drowned in it. A similar story is told of a maiden named Gile, whose drowning formed Lough Gill, and so it is possible that the two may have originally represented the same figure in both maiden and hag form. In Co. Meath and nearby Co. Cavan, a woman named Garrawog broke the Sabbath by eating blackberries on her way to church. As a result, she was transformed into a giant serpent or cannibal and dissolved when St. Patrick threw holy water at her. However, in other versions of the story, Patrick threw his staff at her and as a result, she split into four pieces. One piece went up into the air, two went off to the sides into lakes, and the final piece disappeared underground beneath a large rock. The idea that the hag split into pieces that travelled in the four directions suggests that Garravogue was an ancient goddess figure suppressed by Christian apologists. Usually, cosmic goddesses whose bodies form the tangible world are described in this way. The legend that Garrawog will rise again when enough people bearing her surname (Gargan or Garraghans) walk over her grave is evidence that the hag goddess was not entirely suppressed under Christianity. A carved head in Clannaphillip, which was once situated in a church, but now resides behind the Virgin Mary grotto, is believed to represent Garrawog."
