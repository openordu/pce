    "text": "In folklore, there existed a particular motif involving fairies known as trooping fairies. Fairies were classified into two types, the Solitary Fairies, such as the Leprechaun, who preferred their own company and avoided others of their kind. The more common trooping fairies lived together in magnificent palaces where they spent their days dancing and singing. Some writers have described a third type of fairy, the domestic fairy, like the Brownie. Although they lived without other fairies, they were sociable to humans. Generally, these fairies caused no harm to humans who left them alone, but occasionally they rode forth on the Wild Hunt to abduct babies and brides to be taken away to Fairyland."
