    "text": "Near the ancient Celtic harvest festival of Lughnasa, in the small village of Kilorglin in the province of Munster in southwest Ireland, a peculiar ritual takes place on a weekend: the Puck Fair, an Irish folkloric festival. The event commences as a wild goat is captured from the nearby mountains and brought into the village square where it is crowned as king. The Puck then reigns over three consecutive days of events comprising Gathering Day, Fair Day, and Scattering Day, which hosts a variety of festivities including horse shows, outdoor games, music, and drinks for all. Once the fair concludes, the goat is returned to its mountain home. The locals maintain that the customs associated with this festival have been passed down over time immemorial, although scholars propose that it is a relatively recent creation dating back approximately 300 years. This argument is supported by the lack of symbolic importance attributed to the goat in Celtic culture, as well as the use of the word Puck, derived from British, rather than Irish vocabulary (for Irish, see Pooka)."
