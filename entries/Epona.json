    "text": "Epona, a Continental Celtic and British goddess, is a unique exception among the polytheistic people whose vision of divinity made it rare to find the same name of a god or goddess more than once, because statues and altars to her have been uncovered across continental Europe as well as in Britain, more than for any other god or goddess of the Celts. Epona was associated with horses, even though little is known about her, which means \"horse\" from the Gaulish epos, and she was depicted in various poses involving horses, such as astride a horse (usually a mare), surrounded by horses, or even occasionally lying naked on the back of one. In Roman Gaul, particularly in Burgundy, and in the Metz-Trier and Meuse valley regions of Germany, the greatest concentration of inscriptions to Epona are found in the form of images and altars. Although she was also worshipped in Britain, the expansion of her domain might have occurred following Roman occupation. The legions favoured her as a goddess, and they may have brought her across the North Sea with them. The soldiers also brought Epona back to Rome, making her the only Celtic goddess granted a feast day (December 18). Epona, however, is clearly not Roman, because their pantheon did not include any such equestrian goddesses. Often Epona carried a plate called a Patera; sometimes, she bore symbols of abundance, such as sheaves of wheat and ears of grain, a serpent, or a cornucopia. Because the invading armies fully adopted such a prominent goddess, it is probable that she was linked with prestige and power, and her worship may have been particularly strong among the horse-riding warrior elites who others might have wished to imitate. Epona's potential association with royalty is suggested by the fact that many kings in Gallo-Roman society rose from her class of worship. While soldiers may have been responsible for spreading her worship, Epona's appeal was more far-reaching than that; small, personally made altars dedicated to her have been found in homes. These altars often depicted Epona as a maternal figure, feeding horses or accompanied by a mare and foals. Additionally, depictions of horses with any goddess is generally assumed to represent Epona, symbolizing her role as the goddess of animal and land fertility. In rare instances, she is referenced in the plural form, Eponas, which highlights her fertility and reproductive powers. Despite her influence over horses, Epona should not be confused with animalistic deities like Cernunnos, the stag god. Though she is often depicted on horseback or with horses, Epona is not generally portrayed as a horse herself. Similar to other mother goddesses, she is sometimes depicted with death-related symbols, such as the Raven or the Dog. She is also often depicted carrying keys, a symbol of her ability to unlock the treasures of the Otherworld, potentially making her a guide or guardian figure for those making the journey. Ceits often associated horses with the sun, so Epona's duality in associations with abundance and death could mirror the sun's power to make the plants grow during the day, and its symbolic death as it sets and disappears beneath the horizon at night. Her connection with hot Springs, supposedly warmed by the sun's passage on the earth's nether side, supports the interpretation that Epona, being the goddess of thermal springs, was connected to Apollo and Sirona. Even though Epona was quite popular on the Continent as well as in Britain, there is no hint of her presence in Ireland, and her representation in Wales is minimal. However, the horse goddesses Macha and Rhiannon were respectively found in Wales. Comparable deities were common among the insular and continental Celts, with pictures located closest to Rome and myths and legends in faraway places. The horse goddesses are an excellent example: there are images of Epona found on the Continent, and stories of Macha and Rhiannon from Wales and Ireland. There is a dispute on the degree to which these characters may be related. Also debated is whether to connect Epona to the mare who appears in a centuries-old Inauguration of Kings ritual as Giraldus Cambrensis described. Giraldus claimed that in Celtic times, the man to be inaugurated consumed a stew made from the meat of a mare that had been freshly slaughtered, drank broth made from its blood, and was wed to the land goddess only after performing this ritual. This rite appears to imitate an Indo-European ceremony performed in India, where horses also feature in a marriage inauguration ceremony that confirmed the king's authority over the land. Archaeologists have dated the White Horse Of Uffington, Britain's most renowned horse monument, to the Celtic era; yet, hesitantly, they refrain from associating the flowing chalk figure with Epona. Despite its possible absence of the name, the White Horse is believed to have been carved into the hillside on the Berkshire downs in 50 B.C.E., between the Celtic settlement and the Roman invasion that introduced the worship of Epona in Britain. Since records do not indicate a male deity of horses among the Celts, it is likely that the White Horse, if not Epona Herself, represents a British parallel whose identity was forgotten with the popularity of the Gaulish goddess. Traces of a horse goddess can also be detected in the folkloric Lady Godiva and the mystical woman who rides a white horse in the nursery rhyme of Banbury Cross."
