    "text": "In folklore, butter was a mythical object that held connections to Fairies and Witchcraft. The rural life in Ireland and Scotland centered around Cattle, which provided essential food sources in the form of milk, cheese, and butter, as well as meat. Women\u2019s work in these regions revolved primarily around churning butter from cows\u2019 milk: they would beat the milk until the butterfat would congeal, forming a yellow mass. The leftover buttermilk was consumed as a drink, while the butter itself was shaped and kept for future use. However, the process was prone to failing, sometimes leaving behind only a half-congealed and half-liquid mess instead of thick butter. The most common complaint was that, no matter how hard they churned, the butter would not thicken from the liquid milk. It was believed that someone was \"stealing\" the butter, which was forming within the churn but was being whisked away. Fairies were commonly blamed, as they had a particular hunger for butter, but Witches were also accused of the butter theft. (See Buttery Spirits.)"
