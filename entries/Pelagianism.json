    "text": "Fifth-century Christian philosopher Pelagius, who is believed to have been a Celt originating from Britain or Ireland, introduced a cosmological concept that was later known as Pelagianism. Pelagius\u2019s philosophy, which was perceived as a \"happy heresy\" by his many followers, claimed that everything in creation was good, and that humans needed to learn to love everything that exists. St. Jerome, a Pelagian opponent, once remarked that Pelagius was \u201cstuffed with Irish porridge.\u201d Augustine, a North African cleric, had been heavily influenced by the Persian sage Mani's dualistic philosophy in his youth, which was an influence that he never completely abandoned (see Duality). St. Augustine took up arms against Pelagianism, and their conflict became one of the defining moments for the emergent Christian church. Augustine, a charismatic and brilliant leader, fiercely contested Pelagianism, which reflected a traditionally Celtic concept of Nature."
