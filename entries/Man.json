    "text": "Settled in the fourth or fifth century C.E. by Irish sailors, the small Island of Man (also known as Mannin or Ellan Vannin) lies between Britain and Ireland. Its name was given by the Irish pioneers who worshipped the sea god Manann\u00e1n Mac Lir. Although not far from the mainland, the Island was difficult to reach due to frequent storms that isolated it from the rest of the world. As a result, the Manx language slowly evolved into a distinct language from Irish. The inhabitants of the Island were sailors who had control over the islands far to the north, the Hebrides. However, in 1263, these islands were lost to Scotland at the battle of Largs. Even in recent times, many ancient customs were still practised on the island, including the Tynwald, the longest-running parliament in Europe, and stories of mythological significance that remained part of the oral tradition. However, the arrival of scheduled boat service in the 1830s encouraged the decline of the Manx language in favour of the English tongue. Eventually, in 1974, the last native speaker of Manx passed away at the age of 74."
