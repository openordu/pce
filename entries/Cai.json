    "text": "Irish hero Cai was the first Brehon or judge in Ireland. Though obscure, he was a member of the Milesians, and had received education in Egypt where he learned the law of Moses as well as played a role in M\u00edl's marriage to Pharaoh's daughter, Scota. At the time of the biblical flood, Cai accompanied Moses to the desert where he ended up enduring the same hardship. Eventually, he left Moses and joined his own central European compatriots. After serving as brehon to the invaders from there, he sailed for Ireland. This figure is also known as the Arthurian hero, Kay."
