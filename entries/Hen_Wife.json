    "text": "A figure in Scottish folklore known as the Hen Wife (Cailleach nan Cearac) was believed to possess magical abilities due to her work with chickens on farms in the Scottish Highlands. It is interesting to note that men in the same line of work were not accorded the same reverence. Tales about the Hen Wife are abundant in Scottish folklore and her association with the goddess of animals, Cailleach, is subject to debate. Others believe it may simply be a result of the perceived power of women who earned their own living selling eggs and meat."
