    "text": "The Celtic priestly class was known as druids, a term derived from a word that denotes both \"oak\" and \"wise.\" The druids did not commit their beliefs to writing; instead, they transmitted them orally to chosen initiates. Even so, various sources help us understand the druids, particularly Roman writers such as Caesar. According to Caesar, the druid priesthood included magicians, poets, philosophers, and lawyers, all important roles in Celtic society. Every year, a chief druid presided over a meeting held at the center of the Celtic territories in Europe, where the druids discussed and resolved issues. Both males and females served as druids, although the functions of each may have differed. To become a druid, one underwent a rigorous training period that qualified them to serve as a seer using various methods to predict and advise individuals and tribes. The druids used methods such as incantation (D\u00edchetal Do Chennaib), psychometry (Teinm Laeda), writing (Ogham), or trance (Imbas Forosnai) to discern the course of action for individuals and tribes. As such, they served as political advisors and counselors. They also performed sacrifices of a seasonal and emergency nature since they had the gift of prophecy; their work was essential to everyone in the society, from herdsmen to kings. The druidic role's character and qualifications remain unclear; it is unknown whether it was an inherited position or if like Asiatic shamans, the Celtic druids were called through a spiritual vocation. Druids served as educators, teaching young individuals subjects such as religious concepts, mathematics, astronomy, writing, and the history of their people. These pupils would then return to their respective classes in society. Since memorization was the primary mode of learning, future rulers, warriors, and craftsmen could easily access the knowledge they received during their training. There is scholarly dispute as to whether druids and bards were part of a single order or separate orders, but their duties often overlapped. Bards were responsible for composing poetry, which they did while in an altered state of consciousness. They also had Satires at the ready in case a king behaved unfavorably. Verbal magic was an important part of Celtic belief, and while poets were the master of this art, they did take part in other magical rites, such as the Bullsleep, where they attempted to dream the identity of the new king. The duties of the druid and bard overlapped with those of the Brehons, the legal experts, making it difficult to draw clear demarcation lines between these groups. Some authors have proposed a correlation between druidic practice and shamanism, a religion from the arctic regions based on the idea that other worlds beyond the visible world could be reached through altered consciousness (see Celtic Shamanism). The druids engaged in actions such as eating acorns before prophecy, enclosing themselves in darkened rooms, chanting incantations, and attempting to enhance their senses to see visions. Advocates of the druid as shaman perspective have gained numbers in recent years, although some scholars limit the term to religions born from the spiritual practices of Siberian magicians. Presently, we possess hardly any knowledge surrounding the religious ceremonies held by the druids. It appears that these ceremonies were held outdoors, possibly in revered groves known as Nemetons. It is very plausible that oak groves were favored locations for these practices as oaks held significant sacredness. It is a topic of argument whether Human Sacrifice was incorporated into these rituals. Caesar mentioned the burning of individuals and animals in wicker cages, but his reliability is questionable as he was an adversary of the Celts and may have intentionally or inadvertently depicted them as savage barbarians. Christianity's arrival marked the end of the druids. Some of these individuals had already been stripped of their power. Upon the Romans' arrival, the druids' sacred groves were set ablaze on the Continent and a massacre took place on the sacred isle of Anglesey in the Irish Sea. With their sanctuaries destroyed, the druids lost their influence. A few druids may have become Christian monks or accommodated the new religion in some other way but many died with their knowledge forever sequestered in their minds. The past few centuries have seen a variety of revivals of druidic practices, from the Gorsedd poetic competition in Wales founded in 1792 to a number of Celtic shamanic societies existing today."
