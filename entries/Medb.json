    "text": "Irish goddess and heroine, Medb, was a queen who reigned with great vigor and power from her royal seat at Cruachan, the great capital of the western province of Connacht. The figure of a goddess, perhaps the goddess of the land, stood behind her, and her marriage to the king granted him Sovereignty over her territory and hedged him about with sacred vows (see Geis) at the same time. As a goddess, Medb is linked with the Five fierce figures known collectively as Badb or, and sometimes including the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan. The Celtic Iron Age left more than 70 ritual and royal sites visible in Medb's capital, now Rathcrogan near Tulsk in Co. Roscommon, including the nearly circular main Hillfort where it is believed that the local kings went through the ceremony of Inauguration. A nearby Cave with a tiny entrance called Oweynagat was the birthplace of Medb, who was born to an otherwise obscure woman named Crochan Crocderg (\u201cthe blood-red cup\u201d or \u201cred cream\u201d). Crochan, who was originally from the royal hill of Tara, fled with her mistress, the reborn fairy queen \u00c9tain, from the king Eochaid, \u00c9tain\u2019s human husband, who followed in hot pursuit. When they reached Oweynagat, the pregnant handmaiden so admired the fairy palace or S\u00eddhe there that \u00c9tain made a gift of it and named the area around it after Crochan. The story of the princess or priestess Erne, after whom an important lake and river are named, also involved a flight from danger. Erne received several valuable possessions from Medb, among them her Comb and casket, both representing feminine sexuality. However, their exchange was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a Giant from Oweynagat, causing a frightened Erne and her serving women to run towards Assaroe, where they drowned and became Lough Erne. Similar legends are common in the vicinity of Cruachan, such as the story of Gile who transformed into Lough Gill, as well as in narratives of River deities like B\u00f3and, S\u00ednann, and Garravogue. Medb's name implies \"mead\" or \"intoxication,\" which can allude to the cup she offers at the king's inauguration or the exhilaration of battle, both figuratively and literally. In folklore, Medb is known for her fiery and independent spirit, engaging in sexual relationships without inhibition either for pleasure or political gain through her \"friendly thighs,\" a well-known phrase from the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge, the epic tale of her Cattle Raid upon Ulster. She was always in the company of \"one man in the shadow of another,\" another famous phrase from the T\u00e1in. Although Ailill mac M\u00e1ta was her main consort, she favored Fergus mac R\u00f3ich, a well-endowed man with a matching sexual appetite. Fergus played a crucial role in Medb's cattle raid, prompted by a conversation in bed, where Medb extolled her possessions and Ailill boasted of having more than her, causing a reduction in her social status under Brehon law. In search of a great bull that could match Ailill's in her own herd, Medb discovered the only rival available was in Ulster. This was the brown Donn Cuailnge, located on a minor king's land known as D\u00e1ire. The two bulls were once bitter enemies that were fated to cause great trouble, and Friuch and Rucht are the perfect proof of that. Medb initially attempted to plead with D\u00e1ire to loan her the brown bull for a year, hoping that her Cows would birth astonishing offspring if impregnated by him. However, her request did not sit well with D\u00e1ire, who overheard her boasting warriors and did not take kindly to them. D\u00e1ire then prepared for war with Medb, who had already anticipated such a turn of events. Medb wanted to take advantage of the Curse that would leave the men of Ulster powerless to protect themselves, and she knew of the Curse because of the goddess Macha. Macha had cursed the men in retaliation for their mistreatment of her while pregnant. Medb marshaled her armies and began her march towards Ulster from Cruachan going north and east while traveling in an open cart surrounded by four chariots. Although she was dressed in all her royal finery, Medb had not factored in the strength of C\u00fachulainn, the hero who single-handedly defended Ulster from many great Connacht champions. As the fight raged, Medb seized the opportunity to kidnap the bull she needed. The Ulstermen eventually recovered from their affliction and engaged in a massive battle against Connacht, ultimately driving them back. In what could be considered an underwhelming event in ancient literature, the two bulls began to fight each other, and their grand struggle was so extensive that it spanned across all of Ireland's fields. The brown Donn Cuailnge did eventually triumph over Ailill's white Finnbennach, but he too passed away shortly after returning to Ulster. With the loss of the white bull, Ailill's possessions equaled that of his spouse Medb, which made them equals again. Therefore, for Medb, the ending was a happy one. Medb's demise occurred on the Island of Clothrann, located within Lough Ree in the River Shannon, an area that held significant value to her. There was a Well situated on the island where Medb would bathe each morning, rejuvenating her youth and strengthening her power. Her nephew Furbaide Ferbend could not forgive her for killing his mother, her own sister Clothra. Despite the island's isolation, Furbaide practiced hurling stones from a sling until he was confident enough to throw a ball of dried brains over the water, ultimately striking down the great Medb. Medb's final resting place is believed to be the large megalithic tumulus of Knocknarea, located above Sligo. Despite her ties to Connacht, Medb was also associated with Mide, mainly the hill of Tara, where Rath Medb was potentially the site of kingly inaugurations in ancient times. Married to one king of Tara after another, Medb Lethderg (\"Maeve Red-Sides\") is regarded as the great goddess of Sovereignty in Irish mythology. While she is referred to as a warrior queen or war goddess, Medb is also an effective battle leader who is willing to sacrifice her champions for her cause. In the T\u00e1in, her association with warfare is deepened by the presence of the ominous black-winged M\u00f3rr\u00edgan, a superhuman bird-woman who prophesies the fate of warriors before they enter the battlefield. That the home of the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan, Oweynagat, was situated at Cruachan implies that the two figures were closely related in Irish mythology."
