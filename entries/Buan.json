    "text": "An Irish figure, Buan, acted as a heroine. After the hero, Mac Dath\u00f3, met his demise, his wife Buan received his severed head. She posed questions towards it, and like Br\u00e2n The Blessed's renowned head, it responded and disclosed the betrayal that caused his death. Buan experienced overwhelming grief till the point of death, and from her grave bloomed the enchanted Hazel Coll Buana; divination tools made use of branches from these hazel bushes. Buan's lineage may have originated from the ancient goddess, B\u00faanann."
