    "text": "Slane, also known as Sl\u00e1ine, \u00c1ed or Slaine, holds a place in Irish mythology as a leader of the Fir Bolg, who were eventually defeated by the magical Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. Although he is considered a minor figure in Irish folklore, Slane hill, the site of his burial, is widely known. Overlooking the great bend in the River Boyne near Br\u00fa Na B\u00f3inne, an impressive ancient mound, St. Patrick lit a fire on Slane hill during Beltane. On the nearby hill of Tara, the Druids had gathered to light the first fire for the festival night. Seeing the fire on Slane hill, the Druids went to investigate and heard the sermon of the Shamrock from St. Patrick, who would eventually bring Ireland into the Christian faith. Another notable Slane was a doctor of the Partholonians, one of the mythological races that invaded Ireland in ancient times."
