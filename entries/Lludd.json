    "text": "A Welsh saint or goddess named Lludd, was \"converted\" by Christianity, which adopted the same practice as the Roman legions by converting native deities into saints while preserving their symbols and in some cases, their narratives. Lludd was famed for her holiness, and when she was decapitated, a healing spring gushed forth where her head stopped rolling down the hill. The theme of the miraculous head is characteristic of the Celtic tradition, and healing wells are believed to possess healing powers in equal measure. The presence of this Welsh saint points to an earlier goddess. Additionally, Lludd, who is also referred to as a Welsh god or hero, is a significant character in Welsh mythology, and there are several versions of him, which are either aspects or echoes of each other, or they could be separate figures. Lludd Llaw Ereint (Nudd), a former British king, is the most vital among the Welsh mythological figures that share the name Lludd. Lludd, along with his brother, Llefelys, who ruled on the continent, was the son of Beli, the god of death. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Lludd was responsible for constructing London, though the divine figure behind this king, was apparent in Geoffrey's description of the temple that was dedicated to him near Ludgate, which is currently the site where St. Paul's Cathedral stands. Under Lludd's rule, Britain endured three plagues. The first was the Corianiad, a race of demons, whom Lludd vanquished by letting loose poisonous insects on them. The second involved two dragons, which he got drunk and killed with the assistance of his brother. Finally, he slayed a giant magician in a mortal combat. In his play King Lear, William Shakespeare is thought to have taken inspiration from an ancient royal character, although he mistakenly used the name Llyr instead of Lludd, a similar Welsh figure."
