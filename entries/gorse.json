    "text": "A plant with symbolic meaning is the gorse. This sturdy plant is prevalent in harsh as well as fertile conditions throughout Britain and Ireland. In the spring, the rough spiky bushes blossom with velvety fragrant yellow flowers, some of which last through summer. It served two main purposes: as a source of fuel because of its abundance and intense heat it produces when burned, and as the main element in hedges since Cattle avoid its thorny and thick growth. In Wales, a sprig of gorse was worn for protection against Witchcraft. (Topic Furze is also relevant.)"
