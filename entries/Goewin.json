    "text": "Performing the ceremonially crucial task of footholder to King Math of Wales was Goewin, a Welsh heroine or a goddess. It was significant because the king's feet never touched the ground, which indicated that he was a sacred king. Unfortunately, Goewin became the object of one of Math's nephew's lust. Gilfaethwy, who was being aided and abetted by his brother, the deceiver poet Gwydion, violated Goewin. Although he had been severely punished for the crime, Goewin lost her virginity and her position because only an undefiled girl was allowed to hold the king's feet. As a partial compensation, Math married her and crowned as the queen."
