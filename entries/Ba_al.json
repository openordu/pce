    "text": "A non-Celtic divinity, Ba\u2019al was given this title, which means \u201cthe lord,\u201d and it was used for several gods worshiped by the Phoenicians, an ancient Mediterranean people renowned for their sea trade. Ba\u2019al was thought to be parallel to, and possibly associated with, the goddess known as Ba\u2019alat, or \u201cthe lady.\u201d It is occasionally misrepresented as the Celtic equivalent of a hypothetical seasonal god, named Bel, linked to the spring festival of Beltane, celebrated on May 1. There is no proof of the existence of such a deity, however, nor are there any inscriptions or sculptures of Bel, although there is a god named Belenus, whose name appears to have been incorporated into this festival's name. Unlike Ba\u2019al, who was typically a god of the atmosphere, particularly during aggressive weather systems, Belenus was connected to curative springs and occasionally to the sun. Bacorbladhra, an Irish hero, was a member of the obscure mythological tribe, the Partholonians. He was famous as the initial Irish trainer to have existed."
