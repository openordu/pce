    "text": "An Irish hero known as Finnbennach, or \u201cwhite horn,\u201d is a famous figure in Irish mythology as the greatest Bull of the western Province of Connacht. However, under his human name of Rucht, he is not well-known. Rucht used to be a swineherd who once had a bad argument with another swineherd named Friuch. Despite being reborn time after time, their deep-seated enmity had continued to flourish, and they fought each other as stags, ravens, and worms. When the worms couldn't do much damage and were too far apart, one of them told the great Queen Medb to marry Ailill mac M\u00e1ta while the other warned D\u00e1ire to expect an invasion of Ulster. The worms were swallowed by cows and were born again as bull-calves. But, by the time the bulls grew up, the stage was set, and Medb was offended that her husband owned Finnbennach, which made him her social superior. She decided to find a bull of equal value, which was Rucht\u2019s enemy, now reborn as the brown bull Donn Cuailnge. The epic Irish story T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge is about the battle for these bulls. When they finally met, Rucht and his age-old enemy engaged once more in a fight, but this time Rucht was defeated, and his body was scattered in pieces across the land. Friuch, victorious but exhausted and losing blood, did not live long after returning home."
