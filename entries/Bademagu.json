    "text": "In one of the lesser-known tales of the Arthurian cycle, an Arthurian hero named Bademagu (Maelwas) was the father of Meleagant. Meleagant, who was the king or god of the Otherworld, had abducted queen Guinevere, with the intention of making her his consort. Kay, the knight, followed the kidnapped queen but was himself taken hostage because he could not win her escape. Therefore, Lancelot, the queen's beloved, had to locate and release the hostages. He was accompanied by the pure knight Gawain. However, the place where the hostages were kept in the city of Gorre was hard to find. When they got there, the heroes had to cross a dangerous and tumultuous river. There were two ways to cross; one was through a sword-sharp bridge, and the other was through an underwater route, which was safer. Gawain chose the latter option while Lancelot, eager for Guinevere, chose the upper bridge and was grievously wounded. In his injured state, Lancelot had to fight Meleagant. King Bademagu, Meleagant's father, a kind man, compelled his son to return the kidnapped queen."
