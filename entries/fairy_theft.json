    "text": "The theme of stealing from fairies is a popular motif in folklore. Despite their aversion to human robbery, the fairies themselves were notorious for taking items from humans, with food being their preferred target. The fairies were known to extract the essence of such food, coined Foyson or toradh, as their own supernatural nourishment was not as substantial as human food. They commonly stole butter, milk by causing the drinker to spill it and then sipping the essence, and even strong alcoholic drinks. The fairies would take anything that captured their interest, even going as far as abducting humans (see Fairy Kidnapping) and removing them from our world."
