    "text": "The Fir Bolg (G\u00e1ili\u00f3in, Fir Domnann) were an Irish mythological race. The Book Of Invasions, a legendary history of Ireland, speaks of many invasions; while the magical and sometimes monstrous races mentioned are clearly mythical, the text does reflect the historical truth that Ireland was settled in multiple migratory waves. Some of these were by non-Celtic people, including the earliest settlers and later Picts, followed by the Celts, who arrived in several waves. The earliest spoke P-Celtic, and the later arrivals spoke a Q-Celtic language. The exact number of migrations or tribes that came, and the place they originated from, is not conclusively established. What is clear is that Ireland was not settled by only one people, neither was there always a peaceful reaction to new arrivals in already occupied lands. Among these early immigrants or invaders were some, who have become legendary as the Fir Bolg; earlier scholars derived their name from the word \"bag\", thinking that it was connected with them, and called them \"men of the bags\"; however, the current understanding is that their name is related to the tribal names Builg or Belgae, the same Celtic tribes that gave their name to Belgium. These groups may have traced their descent from Bolg or Bulg, a hypothesized ancestral deity, possibly the ruler of thunder; therefore, their name would mean \"sons of the god/dess Bolg\" and would be equivalent to the later Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, or the \"children of the goddess Danu.\" Descended from the children of Nemed or Nemedians, another mythological race who had lived in Ireland generations prior, the Fir Bolg's origins are steeped in legend. Cast out by the fierce Fomorians, Nemed's son Starn found himself in Greece, where his descendants were enslaved for 230 years. They were forced to carry bags of dirt to build up hills. Eventually, they used these bags to build boats and escaped, returning to their ancient homeland. They arrived on the harvest feast of Lughnasa under the guidance of Dela, who then divided the island among his sons. Gann and Sengann received the southwestern Province of Munster, Slane took the eastern province of Leinster, and Rudraige gained Ulster to the north. Dynasties were established and rulers sat on thrones. Eochaid mac Eirc was among the Fir Bolg kings of note, who ruled the middle province with his famed wife Tailtiu. Other notable figures include Rinnal, who invented spear points, Delga, who built the great fort of D\u00fan Delgan, now Dundalk in Co. Louth, Fingein Fisiochda, who was a healer, and hero Sreng. Curiously, there is no mention of the monstrous Fomorians who originally ousted the Fir Bolg's ancestors, although they reappear to ultimately combat the Fir Bolg's own conquers. The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, the most magical of Ireland's mythological races, arrived after the Fir Bolg ruled for only 37 years. In the great combat, called the first battle of Mag Tuired, Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann's king Nuada drove the Fir Bolg from Ireland, losing an arm and his right to the throne in the process (see Blemished King). The Fir Bolg, like other conquered peoples in Ireland, may have retreated to distant parts of the Celtic world such as the Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland. It was there that King Aonghus constructed the magnificent fort of D\u00fan Aongusa. Other areas where the Fir Bolg may have retreated to include islands off the Scottish coast and wild Connemara, where it is said that their king was named Bola, which is possibly derived from their tribal name. Irish place-names such as D\u00fan Bolg in Co. Wicklow, Moherbullog in Co. Clare, and Moyboulogue in Co. Cavan reference this mythological race. If the Fir Bolg truly represents a Celtic people who were driven towards the fringes by later Celtic conquerors, then it is reasonable to assume that the inhabitants of these areas are descendants of the Fir Bolg."
