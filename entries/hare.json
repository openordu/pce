    "text": "The hare is a symbolic animal that is steeped in mysticism and myth. In Ireland, the hare was believed to be a witch in disguise, as it was connected to the Cailleach, who was also considered a witch-like being. If a hare was injured, a witch in the area would also have an identical injury. This belief was observed on the Isle of Man too, where a wounded hare would escape unless it was shot by a silver bullet. After being shot, the hare would turn back into the transformed witch, who may or may not be found with an identical wound. In Scotland, it was believed that a witch would assume the guise of a hare to steal milk, which was commonly targeted for magical theft. These witches would sneak into barns disguised as hares and suckle milk from a cow's udder. If anyone caught them, the hare would instantly transform back into human form. Hares found in unusual places, especially in regions where they were not typically found, were thought to be disguised witches. If pursued, these hares would flee into houses, revealing the witch's lair. A group of hares together was considered a gathering of a witches\u2019 coven. Additionally, the Fairy Rabbit, a bold being that attempted to drown people at sea, shared the fierce temperament of the hare. Folklore suggests that the hare may have had a religious significance in earlier times. Caesar mentioned that eating hare flesh was taboo to continental Celts, suggesting that it was considered sacred or ancestral. Dio Cassius also mentioned that the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca used hares for divination before battle. Fragments of ancient lore indicate that the portrayal of hares as shapeshifters in folklore may have originated from ancient religious symbolism."
