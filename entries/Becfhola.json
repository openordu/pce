    "text": "Becfhola, known also as Beagfhola is an Irish goddess or heroine. The protagonist of the Tochmarc Becfhola (The Wooing of Becfhola), she was a mortal queen of Tara. Her story tells of her affair with a Fairy Lover, Flann ua Fedach. As queen of Tara, Becfhola represented Sovereignty. Her unhappiness with king Diarmait and her preference for the hero Crimthann might have caused Diarmait to lose his right to rule. On an island in Lough Erne, Becfhola attempted to meet up with Crimthann for an assignation but instead met Flann, with whom she spent an enchanted night. Upon her return to Tara, time seemed to have stood still, for she had lived in fairy time with Flann. He soon came to take her away."
