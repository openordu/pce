    "text": "Iarbanel was an Irish hero mentioned in the Book Of Invasions, the legendary history of Ireland. According to the book, Iarbanel was the son of Nemed and ancestor of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, also known as the tribe of the goddess Danu. On the other hand, from Iarbanel's brother Starn came the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann's adversaries, the Fir Bolg. It's uncertain whether Iarbanel had any association with Danu, as his ancestry insinuates, since there are no explicit connections mentioned in the text."
