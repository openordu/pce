    "text": "A Fairy Lover named Tryamour is a heroine in Arthurian tales. In Marie de France's poetry, she exchanged wealth for sexual intercourse with the knight Launfal but, typically, requested that he never brag about their encounter. Launfal, as is common in such scenarios, broke his promise; nevertheless, Tryamour was less severe than other magical beings and allowed Launfal to accompany her in the Otherworld."
