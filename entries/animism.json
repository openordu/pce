    "text": "The Celts, in common with many other ancient civilizations, believed that the world around them was filled with animate spirit, a religious concept known as animism. Unlike some cultures, however, this did not manifest as a singular, abstract nature divinity, but was customarily place-specific and polytheistic. Thus, a significant outcropping of rock might be imbued with the essence of a goddess, or a towering, ancient tree with that of a god. Frequently, these deities were particular to the locality itself; the spirits of many wells, for instance, did not roam freely across the landscape to meet distant tribes, but rather remained confined to their own sacred waters. Some scholars contend that this animistic outlook, possibly originating with pre-Celtic societies, was ultimately integrated into the Celtic Christian tradition. For further information, refer to Genius Loci."
