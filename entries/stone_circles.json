    "text": "Numerous stone circles of all sizes, from miniature to colossal, are scattered throughout the islands and peninsulas of the Celtic regions, representing a mythical location. Constructed by the Megalithic Civilisation many years before the emergence of the Celts in historical records, the stone circles were frequently kept sacred and relatively undisturbed as towns and fields were built around them. Avebury is an example where the town was established within the stone circle, which is one of the largest in Great Britain. While at times the stones were relocated or destroyed in historical periods, they were generally preserved in folklore, which is often erroneously referred to as \"superstition,\" since the archaeological sites were believed to be inhabited by the Fairy race."
