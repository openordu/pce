    "text": "\u00c9sa, also spelled as Esa or Ess, was a heroine in Irish mythology who played a minor role. She was the daughter of \u00c9tain, a gorgeous fairy woman who became human, and Eochaid Airem, the human king of Tara. \u00c9tain was pregnant with \u00c9sa when Midir, the fairy king and her first love, arrived from the Otherworld to take her back. Later, Eochaid ended up marrying his own daughter \u00c9sa unknowingly as he was tricked into believing that she was \u00c9tain. The child of Eochaid and \u00c9sa was the woman who became mad and eventually turned into a queen known as Mess Buachalla."
