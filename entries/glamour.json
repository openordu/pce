    "text": "Folkloric symbol of enchantment. The concept of a glamour originated in Scotland and referred to a spell cast by beings such as witches, fairies or even gypsies, capable of distorting human perception and leading them to visualize non-existent things or realities that aren't true. However, over time, the term has lost its magical connotations and has come to mean only an irresistibly captivating personal charm. Previously, glamour was considered a force to be avoided or broken, a process that required either the application of Fairy Ointment, or the use of four-leafed clovers or Shamrocks, believed to be essential fairy ointment ingredients. By using the power of the clover, people could perceive reality instead of fairy illusions. Thus, someone visiting Fairyland would see a bleak cave rather than a splendid ballroom and those who inhabit it would appear old and withered rather than firm and youthful."
