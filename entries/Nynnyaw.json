    "text": "Welsh hero Nynnyaw, who was the offspring of god Beli, engaged in a war alongside his brother Peibaw which led to the destruction of all land. The cause of the war was their disagreement regarding astrological interpretations. The motivation for a war of this magnitude was unremarkable, and as a result, the brothers were transformed into animals to impart a lesson upon them."
