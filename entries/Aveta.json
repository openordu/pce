    "text": "The Continental Celtic goddess named Aveta was associated with the healing Spring of Trier in Germany. Aveta was often depicted as a nursing mother, implying that she could have been a tribal ancestor. Additionally, Aveta was shown holding baskets of fruit, which is suggestive of her control over Fertility. She was also often shown accompanied by Dogs, which, according to the Celts, had Otherworld or afterlife powers. In Celtic folklore, it was believed that Fairies had a strong desire for humans, particularly infants, beautiful maidens, strong young men, fiddlers, and midwives, and would often abduct them away from their ordinary lives into the beautiful but sterile Fairyland. The people who were taken were said to have been \"taken away\" or just \"taken.\" The individuals who returned were typically oblivious to how much time had passed, as a night in fairyland was thought to be hundreds of years in our world. Sometimes, the fairies would replace the stolen person with a replica, while at other times, the person would simply vanish. Children were considered to be especially vulnerable to being taken, as fairy children were frequently sickly or withered, unlike human infants who are plump and cheerful. People believed that putting a piece of iron in the baby's cradle would keep the child safe from being substituted with a Changeling. In Ireland, people believed that the taken person could escape by wiping the eyes with an ointment made from Shamrocks or four-leafed clovers to remove the vision of fairyland. Changelings were strongly believed in, and the belief caused several murders. The seamstress Bridget Cleary was burned to death in 1895 because she was accused of being a Changeling. On the Isle of Man, the belief in Fairy Kidnapping continued until recently. There is also another interesting topic that deserves attention, namely Fairy Lover."
