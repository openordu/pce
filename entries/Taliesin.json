    "text": "Taliesin, also known as Taliesin Pen Beirdd and Telgesinus, is a Welsh hero and poet. Like other great Celtic Bards, Taliesin was believed to be the reincarnation of an earlier mythic figure. In his youth, Taliesin was known as Gwion, a servant to the great goddess Ceridwen. When Ceridwen's son Afagddu was born ugly, she decided to give him the gift of inspiration and Poetry to make up for it. She brewed a potent mixture of herbs that needed to be stirred constantly as they cooked for a year and a day. Whenever Ceridwen was busy, Gwion was assigned the duty of stirring. While stirring the pot, the mixture bubbled over, burning Gwion's finger. He popped his finger into his mouth, inadvertently absorbing all of the magical power Ceridwen had intended for her son. Gwion's new vision enabled him to see how Ceridwen would react when she discovered what had happened. So, he ran away, with Ceridwen in hot pursuit. Gwion transformed himself into a Hare using the Shape-Shifting power he had gained from the brew, but Ceridwen became a greyhound and chased after him. Every time Gwion changed form, Ceridwen transformed as well: Fish and Otter, Bird and Hawk, with Ceridwen always on his tail. Eventually, Gwion turned himself into a grain of wheat, and Ceridwen became a hen, consuming him entirely. Eating in Celtic myths is known to result in pregnancy, as was the case with Ceridwen, who gave birth to Gwion and sent him floating on the sea. Elphin, a nobleman, discovered the baby and brought him into his home, raising him with care and later naming him Taliesin, meaning \u201cradiant brow.\u201d Taliesin became the most articulate poet in the land, gifted with the ability to see through the veil to the Otherworld, much like Irish poets Amairgin and Tuan Mac Cairill. His storytelling conveyed numerous incarnations, both animal and human. Legend has it that he lies in a rock-tomb in Dyfed, called Bedd Taliesin - anyone who sleeps there wakes up either a poet or insane. Although the literary works of Taliesin may have genuinely come from a poet with that name, the famous identity may have attracted poems from the oral tradition, thus creating a blurred line between fact and myth."
