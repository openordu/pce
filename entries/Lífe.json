L\u00edfe, also known as the goddess of the plain, was a central figure in ancient Irish mythology. She was celebrated for her enduring beauty, her sweet nature, and her industriousness as she tirelessly tended to the river and the surrounding area. However, her tragic death while giving birth at Port Agmar in Aran left her husband, either Deltbanna or Drucht's son, inconsolable with grief. Nevertheless, her legacy lived on through their son, who not only became a great ruler but also perpetuated the memory of his mother's love for the river and the plain which bore her name."
