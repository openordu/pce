    "text": "Fer \u00cd, or Fer Fi, is an Irish hero who may have been a god. He was a talented harper from Munster who could play his harp so beautifully that all who heard it could not help but respond. Whether he played a sad song, a happy tune, or a lullaby, all were affected accordingly. Regrettably, his playing inadvertently caused strife between foster brothers Lugaidh mac Conn and E\u00f3gan. The argument arose as to whose court Fer \u00cd should play at, and eventually resulted in a bitter feud that culminated in E\u00f3gan's death. Fer \u00cd was the father of \u00c1ine and her twin sister Grain, who were significant fairy queens of Munster. This implies that Fer \u00cd may have been a fairy king or a diminished god himself. In the region of Lough Gur, Co. Limerick, Fer \u00cd was described as a red-haired dwarf and the brother of \u00c1ine. He played suantraighe, also called \"sleep music,\" on his three-stringed harp. His playing put not only people, but also the world to sleep. Because of this, the springs that fed Lough Gur froze and appeared like stones beneath the water\u2019s smooth surface. Furthermore, he could play gentraighe, or \"laughter music,\" which made people burst into uncontrollable laughter."
