    "text": "Jowan Chy an Hor, also known as John of Chyanhor, is a significant figure in Cornish folklore. As the Celtic language of Cornwall has limited written literature, the only known folktale in this language is about this heroic peasant and his adventures. His feats showcase his intelligence and determination, which is a common trait among other folkloric heroes who wander the countryside."
