    "text": "A British folkloric figure known as Black Vaughan is said to have haunted Lancastershire after his death. This savage ghost was so despicable in life that he continued to torment his neighbors even in death. There were even reports of him transforming into a fly to scare horses. However, the ghost was eventually expelled by a woman with a newborn baby. It was said that Black Vaughan could not bear the purity and innocence of the child."
