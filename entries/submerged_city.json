    "text": "The theme of a submerged city is prevalent in Celtic mythology. It is said that Inchiquin Lake and Lough Gur in Ireland both have cities at the bottom of their rocky depths. Similar tales are found in Wales, where the Lowland Hundred in Cardigan Bay is said to have existed, and in Brittany, where the enchanted city of Ys rested in the sea off Pointe la Raz. These submerged cities included Fairy cities, which were believed to be part of the Otherworld, also known as the Land Under Wave. Some were once thriving surface cities that sank, possibly due to the decision of their inhabitants to withdraw from the mortal world or because of a curse cast by an evil entity. Although these tales may seem fanciful, there could be some historical truth to them as sunken settlements have been discovered in the regions covered by the Irish and North Seas, as well as the Atlantic Ocean, following the retreat of glaciers."
