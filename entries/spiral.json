    "text": "Renowned for its interlacing spirals, Celtic art prominently features this mythological motif on metalwork like shields, jewelry, and tools that were discovered throughout their lands during the height of the culture. Even in the Christian Middle Ages, this motif persisted and was incorporated into masterworks such as the Book of Kells with its ornate spiraling ornamentation. Though today the spiral is commonly associated with the Celts, it is debatable whether the Celts were the original innovators of the spiral, or whether they merely adapted it from the Megalithic Civilization's imagery. The Megalithic Civilization was known for carving great spirals across their stone monuments, many of which are complicated artworks that suggest their spiritual significance. The origin and transmission of the spiral from pre-Celtic people to the Celts have not yet been thoroughly researched."
