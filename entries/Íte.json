    "text": "\u00cdte, or Ita, was a Christian woman who lived during the sixth century C.E. In addition to her historical significance, legends about her abound with pagan motifs. She founded a convent called Cill \u00cdte, which is known today as Killeedy in Co. Limerick. Much like the nun Brigit from Kildare, \u00cdte is almost mythical, partly because her name was that of a goddess with whom she was associated. Legends about \u00cdte include the shining of her chamber as though on fire, her alleged ability to cure a man by removing his horse's ears, and her ownership of the mythological Cow of abundance, the Glas Ghaibhleann. Her particular miracles involved the control of the weather and the flight of birds, firmly linking her with the earth goddesses of the Munster region in which she resided."
