    "text": "Gawain is an Arthurian hero renowned for being one of the knights of the Round Table who loyally served the great king Arthur. He was the nephew of Arthur and the son of his half-sister Morgause and king Lot of Orkney. Gawain was also one of Arthur\u2019s earliest supporters. In a famous early English romance, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (c. 1370 C.E.) by \u201cthe Pearl Poet,\u201d which like other Arthurian literature draws heavily on Celtic themes, Gawain faces a challenge from a monstrous Green Knight. The hero confronts him fiercely and strikes the stranger, beheading him. But a year later, the Green Knight returns for another combat. Meanwhile, Gawain encountered three attempts from the wife of his host Bercilak to seduce him, but he remained chaste. Rather, she left her girdle with him, and Gawain, instead of returning the intimate garment, inexplicably hid it. When the beheaded Green Knight reappeared, he exacted three strikes on Gawain, the third of which dealt him a crippling wound as retaliation for hiding the girdle. The story features several Celtic themes, particularly related to beheading (see Head) and triplicity (see Three). Some scholars have interpreted Gawain as a later version of the Celtic Smith god Goibniu. The Green Knight is thought to be a literary counterpart to the British folkloric figure called the Greenman. Gawain is also notable from the tale of Ragnell, a woman bewitched to appear ominously ugly, whom he falls in love with upon discovering her beautiful spirit beneath her terrifying exterior. At the time of their marriage, the woman confided in her husband that she could only maintain the appearance of a young maiden for a portion of each day. She asked Gawain whether it would be better for her to appear as a stunning woman in the presence of his friends by day or as a beauty at night, when he could have her all to himself. Gawain avoided making a decision and instead proposed that she make the choice, prompting her to disclose the answer to the famous riddle, \"What do women want?\" - which he had been tasked with solving. According to her, women wish to be given the freedom to choose their own destiny. Following that, the enchantment that had held her in bondage was broken, and she regained her youthful, exquisite features. This breakthrough allowed Ragnell and Gawain to live happily ever after."
