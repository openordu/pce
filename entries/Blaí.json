    "text": "Irish mythology features Bla\u00ed as a significant figure, a heroine who bore Ois\u00edn. Ois\u00edn was one of the poets among the renowned band of heroes called the Fianna. Sadly, Bla\u00ed was transformed into a deer during a magical attack by an enemy, but as a deer, she conceived her son by Fionn Mac Cumhaill. At the time of Ois\u00edn's birth, Bla\u00ed received a warning not to touch him, but her love was too strong, and she gently stroked him with her tongue, leaving a small furry patch permanently on his forehead. It is worth mentioning that sometimes, this heroic figure is referred to as Sadb."
