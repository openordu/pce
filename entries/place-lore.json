    "text": "Many geographical features in Europe bear names that have Celtic origins. The Celtic influence is especially prominent in the names of places ending in variations of \u201cdunum\u201d, meaning \u201cfort\u201d or \u201ctown\u201d, such as Lyon and Verdun in France, originally known as Lugdunum and Virodunum, respectively. Additionally, place-names that include \u201cnemeton\u201d, meaning \u201csacred grove,\u201d also demonstrate this influence, for instance, Nanterre, which was originally named Nemetodurum. Along with these names, there exist stories about certain features of the landscape which exhibit Celtic influence. As Celtic religion entailed the worship of many gods, each being associated with a particular place and the people residing there, knowledge of these locales retained spiritual as well as geographic significance. In ancient Ireland, it was the obligation of the poets to remember the names of different locations and the myths associated with them. Even now, modern Irish poetry often incorporates the names of specific places; nonetheless, it might not delve as much into the mythological background of those places. The Dindshenchas is a specific type of poem that narrates stories about significant places. Although some of the entries were created by medieval poets to fill in gaps in knowledge, many others contain traditions that extend back to the Celtic past, dating as far back as the 12th century. A hundred years later, an additional collection added further interpretations in prose to extend the poetic place-lore. As a result, these volumes are one of the most extensive works focusing on Irish place-names, although they are sometimes challenging to grasp. Other forms of Irish place-lore were never inscribed but instead were preserved as a part of local oral tradition. To examine such material, scholars must determine if the tales are actual myths, misconceptions, or even fabrications. Celtic lands beyond Ireland have yet to fully develop their studies in place-lore."
