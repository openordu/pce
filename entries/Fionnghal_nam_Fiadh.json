    "text": "A Scottish heroine named Fionnghal nam Fiadh, also known as Flora of the Deer, Sorch an O-rfhuil, Clara of the Golden Hair, and the Crazed One of the Mountains, lived a life similar to the Irish tale of Mis, the wild woman. Fionnghal, a beautiful maiden, was abandoned by her lover who followed his mother's advice to marry a wealthy woman. This rejection drove Fionnghal mad, causing her to run into the mountains naked and scream. She lived there among the Deer and grew hair to resemble a member of the herd. The Deer accepted her as one of their own, even as she suffered from madness. Her family and other pursuers eventually gave up searching for her, except for her once-beloved who continued to track her despite her condition. One day, he found her asleep, naked, and in his own campsite. He covered her with his cloak and waited. Upon waking, Fionnghal was sane and grateful, but she revealed that she was dying, which came to pass shortly after. Her lover brought her body down from the mountains and, after delivering it to her family, he died as well. The two were buried side-by-side, and from their graves, two great weeping willows grew and became entwined."
