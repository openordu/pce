    "text": "A British and continental Celtic hero is Melor, who is believed to have had his roots in the migration of mythological motifs from earlier times to later figures. Melor was known for his supposed murder and decapitation by his evil uncle, but as the assailant carried his head away, it began to speak. Fearing the situation as Melor instructed him to strike the ground with his staff, pure water gushed out, and the staff took root and flowered into a lovely fragrant tree. As a result, many tree-shaded healing wells were dedicated to him, assuming he had replaced an earlier healing god or goddess, by allowing pagan rituals to continue under Christian protection. The continental Celtic folkloric figure, Melusine, is believed to be the daughter of a beautiful water fairy named Pressina, who insisted on a vow from her chosen human mate that he must not witness her delivering their children. As with other such humans, Pressina\u2019s husband grew too excited to comply with the vow once he learned of the delivery of triplets, causing an angry confrontation with Pressina, who disappeared with the children. Pressina, in some versions of the story, was said to have given birth in the form of a huge serpent. She had three daughters; Melusine being the eldest, followed by Meliot and Palatina. All three were raised on a magical island, which was typical of the Celtic Otherworld. Melusine was furious with her father for denying them the comforts of human life by breaking his promise. Eventually, when Melusine was old enough, she orchestrated a raid on her father\u2019s castle, and placed him and all his attendants inside a magical mountain. Upon her return home, she was met with her mother's dissatisfaction at her vengeful action, and as a punishment, Pressina cursed Melusine to become a snake for part of every Sunday. Melusine, like her mother, fell in love with a human man called Raymond of Poitou. And similarly, she set limitations for her husband; never to enter her rooms on Sunday. Of course, human husbands are wont to break such a vow. And when Raymond saw his part-snake wife on a Sunday, she vanished in fury at his betrayal. She continued to haunt his family, in a way somewhat resembling a banshee."
