    "text": "A spinner was required in the Hebrides, and Loireag, a Scottish folkloric figure, was one such fairy. Habetrot was one of her kind, and she was a matron spirit, who, like Loireag, had the appropriate skills for the region. It was a vital financial role for women to produce tweed. Loireag was fierce but plain and small. If any of the rituals associated with spinning, warping, weaving, or washing were ignored, she would be problematic. Additionally, she was a talented musician with a sweet voice. In Scotland, women sang while performing textile duties, as shown in the renowned \"waulking songs,\" a heavy rhythm accompanied the equally rhythmical work of cloth preparation."
