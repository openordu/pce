    "text": "Mugain, also known as Mughain, was a celebrated Irish heroine. Known as the sister of the mighty goddess-queen Medb, she gave birth to a hero-king named Aed Slane. However, before she could do so, Mugain had to learn an important lesson - to be kind to other women. She was one of two wives to the king of Tara, the other being Mairenn. Mugain became consumed with envy over the beautiful golden headdress that Mairenn always wore, suspecting her co-wife of hiding something. To shame her rival, she bribed someone from within the court to pull down Mairenn's headdress. However, it backfired as golden hair instantly appeared on Mairenn's head, and Mugain was the one who was shamed. As punishment for her behavior, she was forced to give birth to a lamb and a salmon, before finally being allowed to bear a human child. Interestingly, some have referred to Mugain as the goddess of Munster, M\u00f3r."
