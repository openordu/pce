    "text": "Irish mythology has a site called Br\u00ed L\u00e9ith, noted for its great Fairy Mound located in the heart of Ireland. This mound served as the abode of the formidable fairy king, Midir, and figured as the setting of many mythical tales, mostly that of \u00c9tain. The heroine, who was Midir's lover in various lifetimes, is believed to have been reborn multiple times. The mound is allegedly named after a little-known heroine named Br\u00ed, who could potentially be another name for \u00c9tain."
