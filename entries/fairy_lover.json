    "text": "A figure in Irish, Scottish, and Breton folklore is the fairy lover (also known as the fairy mistress, lianan sidhe, or la belle dame sans merci). These ethereal women, who were usually depicted as being ravishingly beautiful, were the center of many stories from Fairyland. They often stole away the most talented poets or handsome men from our world, making them their lovers. The fairy lover had to do little to entice these men as their beauty made even the most attractive mortal women seem coarse and unattractive. Through haunting dreams, the fairy mistress called to her chosen mate until he came to reside on her charmed Island in the western sea or under a mound. Once he experienced her charms, he seldom attempted to leave her side because not only was she breath-taking to behold, she was also completely wanton. Time passed differently in Fairyland than in our world, so what seemed like a single night with the fairy mistress would feel like centuries had passed in reality. If the human lover grew homesick and returned to our world, their home was often lost in the mists of time, and they also lost their fairy lover. The tragic story of Ois\u00edn, the great Bard, is a perfect example. He was kidnapped from our world by the beautiful Niamh of the Golden Hair. Despite enjoying his time with Niamh, Ois\u00edn became homesick and begged for a brief visit home. She warned him to stay on his magical horse while he looked upon his beloved Ireland. However, when he leaned down to touch the soil, he fell from his horse and instantly dissolved into dust. Fairies were notorious for their fickleness, which sometimes led to fairy women abandoning their human husbands and returning them unceremoniously to the human world. Most of these men never fully recovered and died soon after, longing for the beauty of fairyland. However, there were rare cases, like that of Thomas The Rhymer, where the man survived and was ultimately reunited with his fairy lover, residing happily ever after in the Otherworld. Several goddess figures were seen in these instances, embodying both the spirit of life and beauty as well as being the foreteller of doom, like the sister of the Banshee. Both took human lovers from this world in different ways. \u00c1ine of the magical lake Lough Gur also served as banshee or death-warner for local families in Co. Limerick. She became the bride of a human earl and bore his son before abandoning him. Occasionally, the fairy king would steal human maidens away, often on their wedding day (see Fairy Bride). There are also tales of male fairies seducing young women in Scotland and Ireland (see Ganconer). However, it is far more common to find the fairy lover in female form, inspiring many artists like the famed English poet, John Keats, who immortalized her as \u201cLa Belle Dame Sans Merci,\u201d the mercilessly beautiful woman."
