    "text": "The term solstice refers to the sun's stillness, as during the summer and winter solstices on June 21 and December 21, respectively, the sun seems to halt. These days signify the year's longest day and longest night. The duration of daylight and darkness gradually decelerates and becomes hardly noticeable before commencing again as the solstice phase ends. That being said, while the Celts did not celebrate the solstices themselves, they must have been able to calculate them since their annual festivities were rooted in that understanding. Refer to Calendar."
