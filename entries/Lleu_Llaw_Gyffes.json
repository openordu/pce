    "text": "A Welsh god or hero, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Llew Llaw Gyffes), became infamous following the goddess Arianrhod's failed attempt to become king Math's footholder. Arianrhod was tested to ensure her virginity before being given the position which was previously held by the maiden Goewin. During the examination, Arianrhod unexpectedly bore two children after stepping over Math's magical rod. To her horror, one of them, Dylan, disappeared straight into the sea. The other, an unformed mass, was taken by Gwydion, Arianrhod's brother who put it in a magical chest. Now a fully formed child, who may have been Gwydion's son, the little boy became Arianrhod's responsibility to name. However, Arianrhod refused to name the child born through trickery. Subsequently, Gwydion, using his wiles, tricked his sister again, eventually winning her over and forcing her to give the boy the name Lleu Llaw Gyffes (meaning \"bright one of the skilful hand\"). Gwydion, again using his wiles, tricked Arianrhod into arming Lleu as a warrior. Arianrhod then cursed her son, claiming that he would never wed a human woman. Yet again, Gwydion tricked Arianrhod, with Math's aid, by forming a woman out of flowers. Lleu was married to Blodeuwedd (aptly named \"flower-face\"). Unfortunately, this marriage brought no happiness to Lleu, as Blodeuwedd soon took a lover and began plotting to be rid of him. Blodeuwedd challenged Lleu to stand under a thatched roof by the side of a river, with his foot on a deer. Since Lleu was protected from harm by the fact that he could not be killed when inside or outside, on horseback or afoot, his wife devised this treacherous way of getting rid of him. In an unlikely position, Lleu took the dare and met his death-blow, only to sail away in the form of an Eagle. As for his murderer, she did not go free; she was transformed into the nocturnal Owl. Although the complex story has little in common with those told about its supposed Irish counterpart, many scholars have deemed Lleu a parallel divinity to the Irish Lugh."
