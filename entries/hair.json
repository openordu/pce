    "text": "Hair holds significant symbolic importance to the ancient Celts, serving as a crucial element in their rituals and spirituality. In battle, warriors maintained long hair and untrimmed mustaches, occasionally treating them with lime to create an intimidating and wild appearance. Women also boasted lengthy hair that was braided or styled in various ways, symbolizing their sexual power. To differentiate themselves from the rest of the tribe, Druids sported a unique tonsure or haircut. The significance of hair hasn't waned throughout time, as many superstitions regarding hair abound in folklore. For example, throwing cut or combed hair into a fire was strictly prohibited, lest the person do so contracted a fever - this reflects magical thinking based on the notion that a part equals a whole. Red hair was considered particularly significant, as it indicated the presence of Fairy blood in the individual. Mermaids would use their combing action to lure sailors, and the principle of Sympathetic Magic made it perilous for girls to comb their hair while their brothers were at sea. The power of animal hair was also recognized, particularly that of horses, a creature whose hair could come to life when dipped into water. In case of a dog bite, binding the wound with hair from the same animal, especially a child's injury, was believed to promote rapid healing."
