    "text": "Irish hero Suibhne (also known as Sweeney, Mad Sweeney, Suibne mac Colmain, and Suibhne geilt), who was once a king of a small area in Ulster, joined a battle to assist the province's king. However, he had wronged a monk named St. R\u00f3n\u00e1n recently, prompting the monk to curse him. The saint went to the battlefield to try to make peace, but Suibhne insulted him once again, killing one of R\u00f3n\u00e1n's clerics this time. R\u00f3n\u00e1n cursed him again, and during the fierce battle that ensued, Suibhne went mad and abandoned his post. Believing himself to be a bird, he climbed a Yew tree every time he was discovered by his supporters, always running away and finding a new tree to perch on. Eventually, he arrived at a monastery, possibly located in Rosharkin, Co. Antrim or Gleann na nGealth (the Glen of the Lunatics) in Co. Kerry, where a relative disguised himself as an old woman\u2014the only person Suibhne trusted\u2014and restored him to his throne. But, when the old woman reminded him that he used to jump high when he was mad, Suibhne once again lost his wits when attempting the jump. He stayed with another madman known as Alladh\u00e1n (or Fear Caille), who tried to leap into a waterfall and drowned. Following that, Suibhne regained some of his sanity. Upon returning to his old palace, Suibhne refused to go inside due to his fear of being captured. Instead, he lamented his life and drifted across Ireland until he stumbled upon a monastery located in Co. Carlow. Here, he had a conversation with Molling, the resident saint, and was in the midst of dictating his life story to a scribe. However, the husband of the monastery's cook became consumed with envy and killed Suibhne with a spear. Despite never being documented as a historical king, it is widely believed that Suibhne was an Irish rendition of Myrdinn Wyllt, known as \"wild Merlin\" in Welsh mythology. Just like Merlin, who became mad after witnessing the massacre during the battle of Arfderydd, Suibhne fled to the woods and sustained himself with wild sustenance whilst making predictions. During his periods of madness, Suibhne spoke eloquently in poetry, making him a beloved figure amongst poets. In fact, both Seamus Heaney, the Irish Nobel laureate, and T. S. Eliot used him as a poetic persona, whilst Austin Clarke drew inspiration from Suibhne in his long poem, \"The Frenzy of Suibhne.\""
