    "text": "Cattle, a symbolic animal, held great importance for the Celts who primarily relied on herding. Their wealth was not only symbolically represented by cattle but was also defined by it in reality. Therefore, many Celtic deities, rituals, and myths were associated with cattle. The white Cow goddess B\u00f3 Find represented the prosperity of healthy herds while the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan symbolized the Otherworld aspect of cattle. She was believed to lead her herds through the narrow passage of the cave at Oweynagat and away from the surface world. Divination was conducted by sleeping in the hide of a recently slaughtered Bull (refer to Bull-Sleep). On Beltane, the start of the summer grazing season, cattle were ritually driven between signal fires to magically ensure their good health and well-being. Butter also had connections to cattle."
