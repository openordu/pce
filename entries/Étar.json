    "text": "\u00c9tar is a heroic character in Irish mythology tied to the beautiful goddess and romantic heroine, \u00c9tain. He has a minor role in the tales and is referred to as \u00c9tain's father during her human reincarnation in some versions. According to other versions, she is immaculately conceived by a queen who drinks up a worm in her wine, and \u00c9tar becomes her stepfather or foster father. The Hill of Howth in Dublin, known as Benn \u00c9tair in Irish, is named after him as he gave his name, meaning \"great\", to it. \u00c9tar is associated with \u00c1ine, the sun goddess and daughter or lover of Manann\u00e1n Mac Lir, the sea god. Upon their wedding, \u00c1ine gave \u00c9tar a golden chain that protected him from drowning and human weapons. Despite this protection, he was unable to avoid dying of a broken heart when \u00c1ine rejected him. \u00c9tar was then buried at Howth. Some texts also mention \u00c9tar as a woman who died from love, but it is unclear whether this refers to another being or the original androgynous god."
