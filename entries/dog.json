    "text": "The Celtic lands are rich in mythology and folklore, and dogs appear prominently in both. Dogs are symbolic animals and are often depicted in various forms. They are the animal form of a divinity, usually a goddess, or a companion to heroes, typically male. They are also associated with the Otherworld as spirit beings. In Celtic lands, it seems that dogs were connected with religion for a very long time, as remains of dog bones found at early sites suggest that they were killed sacrificially. Even today, many people in ancient Celtic lands feel disgusted by the thought of eating dog meat, which may be a memory of a taboo against consuming sacrificial victims.\n\nThe dog symbolizes fertility and abundance and has connections to ancient healing practices. For instance, goddess Nehalennia was always portrayed with a small lapdog reverently gazing up from beside her feet, and fruit and eggs would often appear on the same altars. The dog may have been perceived as a healer due to their tendency to lick their wounds until they heal. This belief led to the mistaken notion in Celtic countries that dogs can heal human wounds through licking. Furthermore, it's possible that the representation of healing goddesses with dogs originates from the period when Celtic lands were occupied by the legions of imperial Rome. The presence of dogs in Celtic mythology is not always tied to their ability to provide healing to humans. A dog is depicted as accompanying a massive goddess on the Gundestrup Cauldron, which was found in Denmark but apparently depicts Celtic myth and ritual. This dog seems to be connected with death, just like the folkloric Black Dog. However, death in the Celtic worldview is followed by rebirth, so the dog images found in graves may have symbolized the promise of future life. Additionally, dog and corn are portrayed together on statues of the goddess, which implies that the Celts associated the death of the seed with new growth, and both with the dog as a healer and psychopomp, or leader of the souls of the newly dead. There are also stories of Irish goddesses, such as B\u00f3and and L\u00ed Ban, who are connected to the Otherworld through their pet dogs. Several gods are associated with dogs, especially Nodens. However, in most cases, dogs are linked to heroic warriors. The Irish word for \"hound,\" c\u00fa, is the first syllable in the name of great heroic figures like C\u00fachulainn and C\u00fa Ro\u00ed. Just as goddesses had lapdogs, heroes had hunting hounds, many of whose names come down to us in legend, like Adhn\u00faall, Bran, and Sceolan, dogs of Fionn Mac Cumhaill, or Drudwyn, the hunting dog of the hero Kulhwch. These dogs seem to have served just as a way to emphasize their owners' masculinity and rarely had personalities of their own, with the exception of Fionn's Bran. Their hunting practices made them participants in the life-and-death cycle by providing sustenance for humans, but also involved the death of birds and other animals. These hunting dogs could be associated with the companions of goddesses due to this embodiment of life and death. Another canine figure, the Fairy dog or Black Dog, was a mysterious and intimidating presence that straddled the line between life and death. This creature, with its burning eyes and terrifying howl, was spotted in Germany, Britain, and Ireland, and was said to warn of death and war. In Ireland, such dogs were connected with the Banshee, or fairy woman who warned of impending death. If dogs howled near the home of a sick person, it was believed to be a bad omen that predicted death. Additionally, the first note of the traditional Irish funeral dirge was said to resemble the howling of the Black Dog. The C\u00fa S\u00edth, or fairy dog, was distinct from the Black Dog in that its coat was a dark green color. It moved without making a sound, always in a straight line, which set it apart from other hunting dogs that followed scent trails in circles. The C\u00fa S\u00edth could bark, but only three times, and on the third bark it would leap forward and devour anyone in the vicinity. According to legend, survivors of these attacks were able to extract a tooth from the C\u00fa S\u00edth. This tooth then acted as an oracle until its owner emigrated to Canada, where it may still be located. Dogs in Scotland were believed to possess supernatural abilities, even if they were not otherworldly creatures. When they barked at the moon or growled for no apparent reason, it was thought that they were warning their human caretakers about the presence of fairies or supernatural forces. Dogs were also thought to possess the ability to see ghosts, witches, and other ethereal beings which were invisible to humans who lacked the gift of Second Sight."
