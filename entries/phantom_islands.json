    "text": "Mythic symbolizes the phantom islands. Belief prevailed that the islands, which emerged and disappeared in a hazy mist, served as doorways to the Otherworld where Fairies, divinities, and the dead luxuriated in perpetual sunny delight. These phantom islands were observable over the ocean or lakes, recurrently in a seven-year sequence, while others came and vanished without a trace."
