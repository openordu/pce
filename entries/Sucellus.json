    "text": "The Continental Celtic god known as Sucellus (Sucellos) bore a name that implies striking, and indeed, he was often depicted with a great hammer or mallet \u2013 the symbol associated with his name. The Dagda, a similar god from Ireland, also carried such an object. Sucellus was a widely-known god found throughout Gaul and sometimes in the company of the goddess Natosuelta. Strangely, the Romans who invaded and renamed many Celtic gods did not rename Sucellus, although he was occasionally tied to their woodland god, Silvanus. Artists often portrayed Sucellus as a bearded, mature man with curly hair who gazed benevolently at viewers. He wore clothing native to the Celts rather than classical garb \u2013 a tunic and a cloak. On some occasions, he wore a crown of leaves or was joined by a hunting dog. Although interpreters have differed on what Sucellus's hammer symbolized, it was very important to the god's identification. Sometimes, the hammer alone represented him. Unlike other hammer-bearing deities, such as the Greek Zeus and the Scandinavian Odin, Sucellus's hammer was not usually associated with lightning. Rather, it was viewed as a symbol of the power of vegetation, thrusting up through the earth. Sucellos is therefore considered a fertility or wildwood god, and his hammer's power to enliven nature made him a god of healing as well."
