    "text": "In southeastern France lies the Coligny Continental Celtic site, which has yielded a significant find in the field of Celtic studies. The Coligny Calendar, made up of bronze fragments, was discovered at this site, and it documents five years of time division. The calendar divides time into a 12-month lunar year, consisting of 355 days, and includes a 30-day month every 30 months to keep it synchronized with the solar or sun year. Archaeologists believe the calendar had a religious use and it was discovered in a shrine dedicated to the Romano-Celtic Mars. To this day, the Coligny Calendar remains the only Celtic calendar found in archaeology."
