    "text": "Amad\u00e1n, also known as Amad\u00e1in or Amad\u00e1in Mh\u00f3ir, is an Irish hero or spirit. Each Fairy Mound in Ireland had its queen and likewise a fool, the Amad\u00e1n, who served the queen wholeheartedly, often causing difficulties without even realizing it. The Amad\u00e1n had the ability to cause a stroke with a mere touch of his hand on human flesh, as mentioned in Fairy Stroke. The Amad\u00e1n is sometimes portrayed as malicious in his behavior that led to difficulties for his victims. Nevertheless, he is more often depicted as a foolish character who fails to understand the serious consequences of his acts. The fool also appears in oral folklore and written texts as a helpless and simple-minded human, as exemplified in the story of \"Shawn an Omadawn.\" Several early collectors record the story, which tells the tale of a somewhat naive boy who outwitted his more intelligent companions or siblings. One of the Fenian Cycle stories, called the Adventure of the Great Amad\u00e1n (Eachtra an Amad\u00e1in Mh\u00f3ir), portrays the fool as the son of a king whose lands were taken away by invaders. In hiding, he grew into a hairy giant who married into the family that dispossessed him, despite his unattractive appearance. However, he eventually sought justice by killing his in-laws. Following numerous adventures and battles, he was reunited with his own family and fought against other giants."
