    "text": "A certain amount of evidence exists suggesting that Celtic beliefs and mythology may incorporate remnants of the faith of a group of ancient people called the Picts, who were known as the \"painted ones.\" This name may have originated from a custom of tattooing their bodies. While some believe that some Picts were part of Celtic tribes, such as the Caledonii and the Maecatae, as some of the Pictish kings had names resembling those of the Brythonic (P-Celtic) language, there are others who contend that the Picts were a unique ethnicity that spoke a non-Indo-European language. Nonetheless, regardless of this debate, it is possible that the Picts were a matrilineal society. This is based on the fact that a large number of the most ancient and supposedly Pictish characters are named in this manner, such as the Welsh Gwydion son of D\u00d4N and Mobon son of Modron, while future heroes and heroines used patronymics based on the names of their fathers. The Picts resided in Scotland, where they left behind traces of their existence in the shape of stone carvings representing symbolic animals and objects, such as Bulls and Horses, Serpents and Ravens, Hammers and Combs. It is uncertain if these images represented religious beliefs or tribal totems. They were allied with Celtic tribes in their struggle against the invading Romans, and the formidable Hadrian's Wall was erected to defend against these powerful northern warriors. They continued to form part of history until the 9th century, when they joined forces with the Scots to form a shared kingdom, and the use of their language disappeared. The pig is a significant animal in Celtic religious symbolism. Its importance is hardly surprising considering that it was a crucial source of meat for the people, second only to cattle, which also played a significant role in Celtic myth and folklore. Unlike today's domesticated pigs, early pigs were smaller and more aggressive, surviving in the pig forests, instead of being confined to pens, where they grew fat on acorns or \"mast\" found beneath Oak trees that were themselves sacred to the Celts. In the early Celtic culture, the pig was considered to be a funeral animal. Occasionally, the depiction of a Boar on a helmet suggests a connection to the warrior class, even if this may have been a reference to the animal's fierceness when cornered. The mythological accounts of pigs include the regenerate animals owned by the Dagda in the Irish Otherworld, which, when sliced by any number of people, would still appear whole and hearty the following day. In Ireland, the great boar- a transformed man, who killed the hero Diarmait Ua Duibne, and an enchanted sow Caelch\u00e9is who was doomed by a harper's song are well-known. In Celtic Gaul, evidence points towards Moccus, a god called \"porker,\" whom the Romans associated with Mercury. On the Isle of Man, there is the Arkan Sonney or \"lucky piggy,\" an Otherworldly creature that, like other fairies, could be recognized by its white skin and red ears. If one could catch it, the creature brought good luck, yet few could ever do so."
