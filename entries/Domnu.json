    "text": "An obscure Irish goddess named Domnu (or D\u00e9a Dumnu) is featured in the Book of Invasions as the ancestral mother of the monstrous Fomorians who were defeated by the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann using magic. Scholars have suggested that the Tuatha D\u00e9, being gods of the incoming Celts, and the Fomorians, who represent the earlier people, indicates that Domnu may have been an ancestral goddess of early or pre-Celtic Irish. She is called \"deep,\" a translation of her name, which may indicate that she is a goddess of the misty depths of the Otherworld or the ocean depths. It is thought that Inver Domnann (Broadhaven) in Co. Sligo may be derived from her name."
