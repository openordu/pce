    "text": "Murna was the mother of the renowned hero, Fionn Mac Cumhaill, and was also known as Murna of the White Neck, Murni, Murni Fair-Neck, Muirenn Munch\u00e1em, Fuinche, and Torba. She was a descendant of \u00c9ithne and the fearsome Fomorian king, Balor of the Evil Eye. Her father, Tadg mac Nuadat, ruled in Almu, but when the warrior Cumhall tried to marry her and was rejected by her father, he took her against her will. Tadg brought the matter to Conn of the Hundred Battles, the king of Tara, who exiled Cumhall from Ireland for his actions. Tadg fought against Cumhall and killed him, but not before he had fathered Fionn upon Murna. Murna, meanwhile, returned home to Almu where her father was furious and threatened her life. However, Conn intervened and took Murna back to Tara. After giving birth to Fionn, Murna's grandson later demanded an honor-price from Tadg for the killing of his father, Cumhall. Reluctant to fight his powerful grandson, Tadg gave Fionn Almu as his seat. It is said that there are other versions of the story where Cumhall was killed by Goll Mac Morna, an unbeatable warrior, and Fionn, in turn, killed Goll Mac Morna to become the greatest hero in Ireland since C\u00fachulainn."
