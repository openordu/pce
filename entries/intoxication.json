    "text": "A popular theme in mythology is intoxication. The love of drinking by the Celts was frequently mentioned by ancient Greek and Roman writers in a derogatory manner. However, there is evidence that both Celtic continental and insular communities enjoyed drinking as much as other aspects of life. Celtic leaders often gave their warriors alcohol before battle to remove fear of injury or death. The sight of blue-painted warriors, wild with drink, charging across a battlefield was noted as terrifying by various ancient writers. In Irish Inauguration rituals, a new king would drink the Ale of the Goddess of the land. It is uncertain whether the king drank enough to become intoxicated or what the drink symbolized. Drunken behavior was commonly linked to the fall feast of Samhain in Irish literature. On this night, the doors to the Otherworld were said to open, and strong drink may have either protected against or enhanced the likelihood of seeing into it. Huge Celtic brewing vats were discovered by archaeologists but very few storage vessels, indicating that excess grain went towards brewing which supplied binge drinking. The excessive drinking would come to a halt until the next Samhain when the cauldrons would be emptied."
