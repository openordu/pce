    "text": "A tree of symbolism, the beech tree was regarded as one of the sacred trees of the Celtic people. Being a member of the Fagus genus, this sizable tree, with its sturdy grey stem and thick, trailing branches, was held in high esteem by the Celts living in the Pyrenees mountain range. The interested reader may refer to the Tree Alphabet for further reading on this topic."
