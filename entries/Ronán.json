    "text": "In Irish mythology, there is a tale about the hero Ron\u00e1n. This story strongly echoes the Greek myth of Phaedra, who became enamored with her stepson, was rejected by him, and spitefully accused him of raping her. Similarly, Ron\u00e1n's second wife, who was considerably younger than her husband, fell in love with her stepson who was closer to her in age. When the young man rejected her advances, she falsely accused him of rape, which led to Ron\u00e1n executing his own son. When the truth was finally revealed, Ron\u00e1n died of heartbreak, and his wife took her own life. Another figure by the name of Ron\u00e1n (also known as Rod\u00e1n and Ruad\u00e1n) was responsible for the destruction of Tara, the once-great central hill that served as the political and spiritual capital of ancient Ireland. When Tara's king, Diarmait, sentenced him for hiding a relative accused of murder, Ron\u00e1n placed a curse on the king and Tara itself, leading to a significant decline in power for the once-thriving location."
