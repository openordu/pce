    "text": "A figure from folklore is the monster. Often, what one community views as monstrous, another community viewed as the gods of a previous age. In several regions of the Celtic world, rather than becoming gigantic and terrifying, former deities became smaller and charming creatures like the Fairies and Leprechauns that feature in the stories of Ireland and Scotland. Giants are also present, mainly in Britain, and behind their terrible appearance are hidden ancient gods. Goddesses often suffered defaming by adherents of male-centered monotheism, leading to some monstrous female entities, such as the Cailleach, being derogatory descriptions of mighty gods of the past. Being monstrous by itself does not always suggest divinity, unless it is combined with shape-shifting or other powers of magic."
