    "text": "Fairy lights are a motif in folklore that originated from the Trooping Fairies. These fairies would journey from one of their Otherworld dance halls to the next, traveling in large processions while holding torches over their heads. Due to the fairy race being smaller in size than humans, the parades appeared as twinkling lights to onlookers. These lights would seem to stream along invisible, but always straight paths."
