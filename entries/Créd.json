    "text": "Two mountains, referred to as the Paps of Danu, are affiliated with Cr\u00e9d, an Irish heroine and Fairy Queen. To become Cr\u00e9d's lover, a man had to compose a laudatory poem describing the palace where she resided, which was heavily guarded and unseen. C\u00e1el, a poet and seer, created a beautiful poem using his inner sight to penetrate Cr\u00e9d's defenses, and his words earned her affection. The poem that won Cr\u00e9d's heart spoke of how wounded men, bleeding heavily, would sleep to the melody of fairy birds singing in her palace's bright foliage. Cr\u00e9d awarded C\u00e1el a magical battle-dress to protect him; however, he was killed while serving his king. Cr\u00e9d, heartbroken over the death of her lover, threw herself into the grave with him and perished too. She was a poet herself, and one of her songs is in the Colloquy of the Elders. A heroine with the same name may have been the daughter of the legendary king Guaire and the ancestral mother of the O'Connors. She similarly died tragically when she fell in love with the warrior poet, Cano Mac Gartn\u00e1in, despite being married to another king. Cano, once a resident of Scotland, was visiting her husband's home where he was smitten with Cr\u00e9d. Similarly, Cr\u00e9d was taken with Cano and gave everyone but him a sleeping draught as she disclosed her desire to him. Cano's pride prevented him from consummating his love with Cr\u00e9d until he had regained his patrimony. As a symbol of his love, he gave her his External Soul, which contained his essence. Cr\u00e9d's stepson intervened, causing so much suffering that Cr\u00e9d took her own life, crushing the stone that held Cano's soul in the process. Several days passed before Cano died."
