    "text": "The gean-cannah, gan-ceann, geancanach, or love-talker is a Scottish and Irish mythological being. Young women were cautioned against traversing secluded country roads, particularly those in mountainous regions, as they might encounter this charming fairy -- unmistakable thanks to his clay pipe -- who would make them promises so alluring that, after disappearing from sight, the young lady would be left to languish and perish. The ganconer was the male counterpart of the much more prevalent Fairy Lover or mistress. The same entity was also present in Ireland, where he was known as the geancanach and was reputed to have a soft spot for milkmaids. Ethna Carbery, an Irish poet, wrote of him, \"Who meets the LoveTalker must weave her shroud soon,\" implying that his love was ruinous. The term used to be employed for human men who were excessively proud of their sexual prowess."
