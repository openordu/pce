    "text": "In the southwestern Irish province of Munster, there is a mythological site known as Paps of Anu (Paps of Danu, D\u00e1 Chich Anann). This site lies on the road between the city of Cork and the picturesque Lakes of Killarney. The area features two hills that are nearly identical in size and shape, known as the Paps. These rounded hills are part of the Derrynasaggart Mountains and are topped with ancient Cairns, stone constructions built over 6,000 years ago by a people who preceded the Celtic settlements in the area. The structure on the western Pap includes not only a mound but also a stone chamber. The Teeth, a group of rocky outcroppings, stand between these two hills. The Paps are often shrouded by clouds, but when the mist clears, they form an earth sculpture with rounded Cairns that resemble nipples atop two rounded hills reminiscent of breasts. In Irish mythology, the twin mountains are known as the Paps (breasts) of Danu, or sometimes Anu, after a goddess who is connected as an ancestral figure with little myth surrounding her. The Cairns at the site are thought to indicate that Danu was a goddess of the Earth. The mythic lore of the Paps features several female figures, including the poet Cr\u00e9d who built her palace on the hills and Crobh Dearg (\u201cred claw\u201d), a strange figure honored at Beltane with visits to a holy well on the Paps. The only male figures associated with the twin hills are the Bard C\u00e1el and the hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill, both of whom were lovers of Cr\u00e9d."
