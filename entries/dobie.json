    "text": "The subject at hand is the dobie, a figure in British folklore. The dobie is similar to a Brownie and while good-natured, it is perceived as being of a rather simple disposition which has resulted in its name becoming slang for an unintelligent person. Some dobies were considered to be ghosts instead of Fairies, and regardless of their nature, both types were known to frequent houses and could be persuaded to depart by way of gifts, as explained in Laying The Fairies. Additionally, denizens of rivers with the ability to alter their forms also bear the name dobie. Lastly, Holed Stones that are situated on the banks of rivers are also known as dobies and are believed to offer excellent protective properties as amulets."
