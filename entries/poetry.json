    "text": "In today's society, poetry is considered to be an art form with little religious significance. However, this was not the case for the Celts. Words held immense power, so much so that they could influence and alter the physical world. This made a poet's words in ancient Ireland powerful and feared; a Satire could bring welts to a person's face, and in extreme cases, words connected with matching rituals could lead to death. The Celtic Bard was seen as both a maker of beautiful words and a diviner or seer. According to ancient sources, Druids and poets were similarly trained and possibly even viewed as different stages of the same profession. Both were skilled in Shape-Shifting, with a druid being able to physically change into various forms, while the poet achieved it through metaphoric words, transforming one object or idea into another. Additionally, poets were historians, and accuracy of knowledge was valued over creativity. Traditional forms were memorized and rote learning may have induced a light trance or meditative state, allowing for visions of the Otherworld to be seen. Therefore, the lengthy and rigorous training in traditional forms may have opened the door to invention and illumination, rather than preventing it."
