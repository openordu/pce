    "text": "Gareth, also known as Gareth of Orkney or Beaumains or Gaheriet, was a hero of Arthurian legends. This minor hero happened to be the son of King Lot of Orkney and Morgause, Arthur's half-sister, and was therefore Arthur's nephew. He was given the nickname \"Beaumains,\" which means \"beautiful hands,\" by Kay due to his most notable physical trait. Unfortunately, Gareth's fate was not kind as he was accidentally killed by his closest friend, Lancelot, in a valiant attempt to save Queen Guinevere from the fiery death penalty."
