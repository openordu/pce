    "text": "A distinctive fairy from British folklore is Malekin. According to the tale, this fairy used to haunt a Suffolk castle following her abduction from her human household who had left her behind in the grass while they went to work in a cornfield nearby. Ralph of Coggeshall, an early folkloric account collector, recorded her story during the 13th century."
