    "text": "Morfran, also known as Morfran fab Tegid, is a figure of Welsh mythology who was either a god or a hero. According to the legend, Morfran's mother was Ceridwen, a great goddess who was determined to make up for her son's ugliness by granting him the world's wisdom. To that end, she brewed a collection of herbs and put her servant boy, Gwion, in charge of watching the Cauldron. However, Gwion mistakenly consumed some of the brew and acquired the wisdom, which infuriated Ceridwen. Not much is known about Morfran apart from the fact that his ugliness proved to be advantageous since he was able to escape the battle of Camlan by being mistaken for a demon. (See Afagddu.)"
