    "text": "At Ogalla, an Irish mythological site, the Celts gave great reverence to Water, both fresh and salt. Many of their myths were situated at or near water sources, and streams and wells, representing pure water that springs forth from underground, were of particular importance in Irish myth and legend. One such narrative describes the story of two princesses of Connacht, Eithne and Fedelm, who bathed one morning in the holy Spring of Ogalla, located near the Great capital city of Cruachan. There, they encountered men who, dressed in white, appeared to be Druids, but they were not Druids; it was in fact St. Patrick and his followers. The princesses were curious about Patrick's god and asked him where it was located \u2013 whether in the earth, the sky or the sea. They also questioned if his god had beautiful daughters and sons. Patrick dodged the question of the god's \"daughters\" and reassured the princesses that the Christian god was all they desired. After their encounter, Princesses Eithne and Fedelm were converted to Christianity and chose to be baptized, after which they died instantly rather than continue to live in a sinful world. The story's end is clearly un-Celtic; similarly, the questions the princesses posed were pagan."
