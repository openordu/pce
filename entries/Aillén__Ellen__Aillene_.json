    "text": "Irish lore mentions an individual named Aill\u00e9n, also spelt as Ellen and Aillene, who is depicted as a hero, heroine, or spirit. The name, which can be traced back to the words meaning \u201csprite\u201d and \u201cmonster\u201d, has been attached to numerous legendary identities in Irish mythology. There are several identities that share a striking resemblance to one another, which leads to speculation that they either refer to the same individual or are modifications of a common ancestor."
