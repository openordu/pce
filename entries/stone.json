    "text": "The symbolism of stone played a significant role in the beliefs of the mysterious pre-Celtic people inhabiting ancient Ireland, Britain, and Brittany. Their remarkable ability in the art of stonemasonry produced structures that lasted for almost six millennia, adorned with their enigmatic artistic carvings. Although the Celts eventually settled in these lands, they did not share the same reverence for the depth of symbolism that the pre-Celtic people had for stone. Nevertheless, the Celts adapted the impressive stone structures, such as Br\u00fa Na B\u00f3inne and Stonehenge, for their own rituals, with a focus on kingly inauguration ceremonies. A remarkable example is the Lia F\u00e1il, a massive boulder in Tara that was believed to roar or shriek only when a true king had sat upon it. At the center of Ireland, the Stone of Divisions was believed to represent a map of the four provinces of the island. The Celts borrowed and adapted the pre-existing stone structures for their own use, thanks in part to their view of the natural world as animated by divinity and therefore sacred. Thus, like trees and running water, stones were significant as evidence of divine power."
