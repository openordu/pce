    "text": "Irish folklore has a traditional belief known as pishogue (pis\u00e9og, pistrog). Although still in use in modern Ireland, the term \"pishogue\" or \"pishoguery\" dismisses old customs and sometimes refers to fictitious stories which appear as folklore. The word originally referred to a bewitchment that was Otherworldly and caused a distortion of reality, also known as Glamour."
