    "text": "Connla, the son of Conn of the Hundred Battles and also known as Connla of the Golden Hair, was uninterested in earthly power after his encounter with a woman from the Fairy race on the mystical Uisneach Hill. As recorded in the Adventures of Connla, he chose to journey with her to her land where the offer of eternal life and pleasure was made to him. After that, he was never seen again on earth. For further information on this tale, refer to Fairy Lover."
