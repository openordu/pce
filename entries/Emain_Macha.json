    "text": "A site of Irish mythological significance, Emain Macha (also known as Emania and Navan Fort) is a late Bronze Age Hillfort located in Co. Armagh. The site is said to be the mythical capital of the ancient Province of Ulster, and the name \"Armagh\" in modern-day Northern Ireland is derived from \"ard Macha,\" which translates to \"the heights of Macha.\" Macha, a goddess belonging to the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, a magical race, left her world to live with a farmer named Crunniuc. During her stay, Crunniuc experienced great fortune in the form of abundant crops and good health for his herds, implying that Macha acted as the goddess of Sovereignty. Crunniuc eventually grew restless and decided to attend the Assembly of Ulster at the court of King Concobar Mac Nessa. Though Macha strongly advised against it, Crunniuc ignored her warnings and promised to keep her presence in his life secret. However, once he reached the Assembly, he broke his promise and boasted that his wife was a faster runner than the king's finest horses. Upon hearing this, King Concobar became outraged and demanded that Crunniuc prove his claim. Despite being heavily pregnant, Macha was brought before the king and begged for mercy. Nevertheless, King Concobar ordered a race to take place, hoping that Macha's pregnancy would slow her down. To his dismay, she completed the race faster than anyone else, but as she reached the finish line, she went into labor. With such force and speed they advanced that Macha died from the excruciating pain and excessive bleeding. She placed a curse on the men of Ulster before her death, proclaiming that anytime their land is being invaded they will experience agony as she did (see Debility Of The Ulstermen). Macha died while giving birth to twins, and the place of Assembly came to be called Emain Macha to honor her memory, which is said to mean \"the twins of Macha.\" Another explanation for the name comes from Irish myth, where the central figure once again is Macha, but this time it is Macha Mong Rua, \"red-haired Macha,\" a warrior woman who battled against her father's colleagues after they rejected her claim to the throne following his passing. She defeated one of her opponents, Cimb\u00e1eth, but his five sons fled. Macha chased them across Ireland and found them camped under the stars in the rocky Burren. She disguised herself as a repulsive hag and crept closer to them, but each of them attempted to assault her as they didn't recognize her. She defeated them and brought them back to Ulster. She forced them to construct a vast hillfort, marking it with a brooch from her neck (eo-muin). This mythological fort still exists near the city of Armagh, and the number of churches in the town indicates its ancient sacredness, as early Christians frequently constructed their churches on land already considered sacred by the Celts. Navan Fort, known as the Hillfort, holds great significance in the history of ancient Ireland and is considered equal in importance to other major capitals such as Cruachan in Connacht, Tara in Meath, or Knockaulin in Leinster. The site has been dated back to 700 B.C.E., which predates the first Celtic invasion by several centuries. This leads to two possibilities: either the pre-Celtic people originally inhabited Emain Macha, or Celtic Ireland began 300 years earlier than what was previously believed. The fort underwent nine rebuildings over 800 years, each less than a century apart. The reason for these rebuildings is unclear and could be attributed to war, ritual, culture, or even a combination of these factors. It is said that one structure was built with the intention of being burned and buried. Emain Macha was a significant political and cultural capital until around 500 B.C.E, ranking after only Tara in Irish mythology, which was closely followed by Cruachan. This may be due to the fact that the Ulster Cycle, which contains the best-preserved sequence of stories from ancient Ireland, was centered around Emain Macha. King Concobar resided in the palace of Emain Macha, and it was the location of the heroic tales of C\u00fachulainn. Additionally, in the epic T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge, the great Queen Medb marched her armies towards Emain Macha for the cattle raid. One wonders if there were equally rich mythologies for the other cities of Ireland, although solely the Ulster Cycle endures as a testament to what magnificent tales may have vanished."
