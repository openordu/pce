    "text": "Folklore often includes the notion of a seventh son possessing a special talent due to his birth order. This belief is prevalent in many Celtic-influenced areas, where the seventh son of a seventh son is considered to be either exceptionally gifted or cursed with Second Sight. In the Cotswolds, for example, it was believed that such individuals could perceive a person's double, a sign that their death was imminent (see Co-Walker). This concept has persisted in some parts of the United States, particularly those with a high rate of immigration from Celtic regions."
