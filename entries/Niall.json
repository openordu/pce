    "text": "A prominent figure in Irish history, Niall of the Nine Hostages (also known as Niall N\u00edoganach or Niall Naoi-ghaillach) was a powerful king of Tara who ruled for over twenty-five years. The meaning of his first name is not certain, but it has been interpreted as \u201ccloud\u201d. As no other heroes before him bear this name, it seems that it originated with Niall himself. The latter portion of his name, N\u00edoganach, signifies \u201cof the nine hostages\u201d and refers to his agreement to take on as foster sons one boy from each of the five provinces of Ireland, and four from Britain (though some sources suggest that one was from Britain, one from Scotland, one from France, and one from Wales). His grave is said to be covered by a stone monument at Tara, which still stands today. Niall is a semi-historical figure and one of the earliest High Kings of Ireland on record, believed to have reigned in the fifth century C.E. He was the father of the important king Loegaire and his descendants became the powerful U\u00ed N\u00e9ill (O\u2019Neill) family, who dominated Irish politics for over 500 years. Niall was known for his prowess as a raiding captain and for taking numerous captives, following in the footsteps of his father Eochu Muighmheadhon (\u201clord of slaves\u201d), who had taken Niall\u2019s mother, a British princess named Cairenn, captive during one of his raids. Eochu\u2019s wife, Mongfhinn, disliked Cairenn and her child, persecuting them until the Bard Torna foresaw Niall\u2019s successful future and helped Cairenn and her son. Niall\u2019s ascension to the Kingship of Tara is shrouded in uncertainty. It remains uncertain whether Niall\u2019s father held the title before him. The period during which all of this happened was deeply infused with myth, meaning that the stories that abound on the subject of Niall are not entirely accurate. An example of this is the account that suggests that Niall and his brothers went hunting one day, only to find themselves in a part of the land that was bereft of game and water. The men came across a Well that was being guarded by an unsightly Hag. The woman demanded a kiss, causing Niall and his brothers to fall back in disgust. Niall, however, came forward to give the afflicted woman the kiss she so desperately sought. The woman, impressed by his kindness, revealed herself to be the beautiful royal called Flaith or Sovereignty. She then bestowed upon Niall the Kingship of the land."
