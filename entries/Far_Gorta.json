    "text": "Irish folklore has a character known as Far Gorta (also called Fear Gorta or in plural, Fir Gorta). This figure is referred to as the \"hungry man\" in Irish legends and is believed to be the Ghost of a person who perished in a famine or a wraith from the Otherworld. Far Gorta was often seen begging by the side of the road, and anyone who provided him with alms was rewarded with good fortune. For further context, one can refer to the legend of Hungry Grass."
