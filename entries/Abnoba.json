    "text": "Abnoba, a Celtic deity, was revered across both the British isles and the European continent. She gave her name to several rivers named Avon, which include the famous one in England that flows through the birthplace of playwright William Shakespeare. Abnoba ruled over the origin of the Danube River in central Europe and held connections with the Black Forest, possibly because of its numerous rivers. Dea Abnoba was one of her monikers and was a simple translation of \"the goddess Abnoba.\" Epigraphs to Abnoba discovered in the Black Forest imply that the Romans equated her with their forest goddess Diana. She was occasionally portrayed as a huntress, accompanied by a hunting dog and a stag."
