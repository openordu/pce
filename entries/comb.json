    "text": "The comb is a symbolic item linked to the Mermaid. According to folklore, the Mermaid sat on a rock and combed her hair, luring sailors to their doom. In line with the principle of Sympathetic Magic, which posits that like attracts like, Scottish girls were cautioned against combing their hair at night if their brothers were at sea, as it might attract the energy of a dangerous mermaid to their vessel. Combing one's hair on a Wednesday was believed to result in sterility, though the rationale for this perception is unknown. In Ireland, the comb held particular significance for the goddess-queen Medb, whose sexual prowess was said to be extraordinary. The comb is regarded as representative of feminine energy, particularly its malevolent manifestation, a theme that Scottish folklore explored with its concept of bad girls combing fleas and frogs out of their hair, while good girls were associated with freeing gold and jewels."
