    "text": "T\u00e9a, an Irish goddess or heroine, remains a mystery with few details of her life available. However, what is known is her association with the revered royal location of Tara, situated at the heart of Ireland, which was named after her. The initial construction of Tara's earthen walls was carried out upon her request, and upon her passing at Tara, she imbued the hill with her power."
