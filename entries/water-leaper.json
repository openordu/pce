    "text": "A water-dwelling creature known as the water-leaper, or llamhigyn y dwr in Welsh folklore, is said to have similar habits to that of the Water Bull and Water Horse. This monster, resembling a giant toad, would lay in wait in the water until it found a suitable target, whether it be a human or animal. It would then emerge from the water and seize its prey in order to devour it submerged beneath the surface."
