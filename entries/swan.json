    "text": "Folklore speaks of the swan as a significant animal, often witnessed as a human who has undergone a transformation, akin to the Seal. On occasion, it was believed that a swan could be a cursed nun. It was considered auspicious to witness seven swans soaring through the sky, signifying seven years of good fortune. If multiple swans were sighted, the good luck multiplied by the number of birds seen. However, if one were to harm or kill a swan, it would bring misfortune not only to themselves but to their community as a whole. To learn more about the swan, refer to Swan Maiden."
