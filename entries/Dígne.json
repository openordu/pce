    "text": "Goddess D\u00edgne, also known as Dige, Dighe or Duibne, was venerated in southeast Ireland as the goddess of Munster's land. Over time, she was merged with Cailleach, the Hag goddess. The magnificent Dingle peninsula located in Co. Kerry, considered as the most picturesque place in Ireland, was named after her. Interestingly, inscribed in Ogham writing, there are discovered artifacts in the area containing the name of D\u00edgne, leading one to believe that she was the ancestral goddess of this region."
