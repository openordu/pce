    "text": "An Irish hero known as Agnoman appears in the Book of Invasions, a mythic history of Ireland. Even though he never made it to Ireland, his son named Nemed founded the Nemedians, who migrated from Scythia to Ireland. There are historians who consider such myths as remnants of lost history. On the other hand, Edmund Spenser, an English poet and political apologist during the Elizabethan era, views the story as a factual account and argues that the Irish were primitive Scythian people."
