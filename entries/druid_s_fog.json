    "text": "The f\u00e9th fiada or ce\u00f3 dru\u00eddecta, known as the druid\u2019s fog, is considered a symbol of the abilities held by Druids. They were believed to be capable of enveloping themselves in a misty shroud and moving past both their friends and enemies undetected. This phenomenon may be likened to Shape-Shifting because a druid could become a veil of mist, an animal or even a bird. Possession of the magical fog was a quality the Druids shared with gods and Fairies; the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann were bestowed this fog by Druids as recompense after losing Ireland to the Milesians. It was also said that St. Patrick had the power to become invisible to those who threatened him. In the well-known \u201cSt. Patrick\u2019s Breastplate\u201d poem, he and a companion walked by dangerous druids unnoticed, appearing only as a fawn and a deer."
