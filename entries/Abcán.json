    "text": "Abc\u00e1n was a god from the Irish mythology who was associated with the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, a group of early Celtic gods from Ireland. In one story, Ruad, a goddess, was transported from the Otherworld to our world in Abc\u00e1n's boat, which was made of bronze and had a tin sail. They arrived at the famous waterfall of Assaroe and it was there that Ruad eventually died. The reason for her death was because she was lured into the swirling waters by the singing of Mermaids from Abc\u00e1n's boat. In another text, it was said that Abc\u00e1n was captured by C\u00fachulainn, a great hero from Ulster, but was able to escape by playing irresistible lullabies that put the warrior to sleep. Abc\u00e1n shares many similarities with Fer \u00cd, a dwarf musician, and may be related to him."
