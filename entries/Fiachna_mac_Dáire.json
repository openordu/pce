    "text": "In the northern Province of Ulster, a Worm spoke to Fiachna mac D\u00e1ire. The Worm had been snagged by Fiachna while fishing in Cuailnge. In spite of the improbability of the prediction made by the Worm, it announced that war would ensue over a Bull from the same region. The Worm had good reason to speak - it was actually the reincarnated soul of a swineherd who, in due course, would take the form of the great Brown Bull, Donn Cuailnge. This Bull would become the main object of the Cattle Raid launched by queen Medb in Connacht. Medb had been informed by means of a different Worm - this time, the bitter adversary of the swineherd who would turn out to be the White Bull of Connacht, Finnbennach - to wed Ailill mac M\u00e1ta. This action led to the epic battle between the two Bulls."
