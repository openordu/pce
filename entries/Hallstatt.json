    "text": "In Austria, near Saltzburg, the Hallstatt Archaeological site was discovered, revealing a vast collection of ancient Celtic artifacts. These objects, including weapons and tools made of bronze and iron, as well as some ritual objects, were dated from approximately 700-600 B.C.E. During earlier times, least adorned objects had been typical but a cultural change was suggested by the design of these artifacts. These items were buried alongside the presumed owners, implying changes in the world view of ancient Celts. This is because the treatment of the dead of this period can give insight into what was expected in the afterlife. The bodies of the Hallstatt era were found encased in a tomb of Oak and placed on four-wheeled wagons. The design of the tomb suggested that the Celts believed that the Otherworld required sufficient grave goods to ensure the soul's happiness. The burial included weapons, tools, ornaments, bronze vessels, iron spears, and traces of meat and poultry. This suggests the beginnings of the Celtic belief surrounding the value of grave goods. It has been posited that the Salt-mining region located near Hallstatt may have been the source of the wealth among the early Celts, who were known to mine and trade in salt. Salt, before refrigeration, was a highly valuable commodity as it was used to preserve meats and other foods. As the Celts were a Cattle-raising people, it had great value in keeping them fed through the long winters. Buried saline deposits were mined and the salt pulverized for transportation and use, further connecting the early Celts to the trade and use of salt."
