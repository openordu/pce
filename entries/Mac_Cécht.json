    "text": "A farmer and husband of one of the goddesses of the land, F\u00f3dla, Mac C\u00e9cht was a minor Irish divinity, who belonged to the magical race referred to as the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. Both Mac C\u00e9cht and F\u00f3dla were possibly deities of agriculture since F\u00f3dla\u2019s name meant \u201cdivided\u201d or \u201cplowed\u201d land, and Mac C\u00e9cht\u2019s similar name indicated \u201cson of the plow\u201d or \u201cplowman.\u201d Water was commonly viewed as a source of healing by the Celts, and Mac C\u00e9cht may have also been a god of Healing, as he walked across the barren land seeking water to revive the dying king of the Tuatha D\u00e9, and a wild Duck led him to a spring.\n\nMac C\u00e9cht had another parallel identity as a hero who fought for the ill-fated King Conaire at Da Derga\u2019s hostel, where he slew the person who beheaded the king and then offered his head a drink before he passed away in a fatal battle with one of the invading Milesians. Mac C\u00e9cht was also the son of Ogma, the god of eloquent speech, and was part of a trio of parallel gods, Mac Cuill and Mac Gr\u00e9ine, who were the husbands of the three land goddesses."
