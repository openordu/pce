    "text": "Nessa, also known as Ness, Nes, and Assa, was an Irish goddess and the mother of the powerful king Concobar Mac Nessa. Raised in high regard and comfort by her father, King Eochaid of Ulster, Nessa was originally called \"gentle one.\" She possessed great personal charm and beauty and was also a quiet and studious girl. Despite always being accompanied by 12 tutors, the lustful Druid Cathbad still set his sights on her. To gain access to her, he heartlessly ordered the slaying of her tutors in one night. However, when Nessa discovered this, she was appalled and angry. She gathered a group of warriors to seek vengeance against the culprit. Though she had never before carried weapons, her rage made her strong and she became known as \"ungentle\" Nessa. She roamed Ireland, fighting wherever she saw injustice but could not find her tutors' killer. One day while bathing in a natural spring, Cathbad found her and took advantage of her. Despite her vulnerability, Nessa agreed to his advances to avoid being killed. It is said that this encounter led to the birth of Concobar, though some legends suggest that Nessa had used magical means to conceive. While living with him, Nessa remained a captive and did not give birth to the hero that was prophesized. Two Worms one day appeared in a pail of water from a holy Well, foretelling an Omen that Nessa received. Nessa drank them down, thus becoming pregnant through the practice known as Pregnancy Through Drinking. Nevertheless, she magically ensured that the child was born clutching one of the worms, so that no one would mistake the future hero for Cathbad\u2019s son. Cathbad died and Nessa married again and this time, by her own decision, she wed Fachtna, another king of Ulster. However, he also died soon after, and the impressive warrior Fergus mac R\u00f3ich, the half brother of Nessa's late husband, assumed the throne and decided to court her. Nessa was already a mother and worried that Concobar, her son, couldn't become the king as he wasn't of royal lineage. Therefore, she beseeched Fergus to give up his throne at Emain Macha for a year, to allow Concobar to become his stand-in ruler. After that, all of Concobar\u2019s descendants could assert that they belonged to the line of kings. Nessa was more devoted to her son than to her husband and thus, after a year of stand-in ruling by Fergus, she kept him from regaining his throne. Furious, Fergus left Ulster and joined forces with the queen of the neighboring province, Medb, who then waged war against Concobar\u2019s territory. The language of the Picts, a people who preceded the Celts in Ireland and Scotland, is where Nessa's name is believed to trace back to. Some researchers argue that the Picts were matrilineal, basing children's family origins through their mother's family instead of their father's family, known as patrilineal descent. Nora Chadwick's writing style involves avoiding any mention of the author and jumping directly into the subject matter. In this particular case, the idea being discussed centers around Nessa and her family. Specifically, it is worth considering the possibility that Nessa may have been Pictish due to the fact that her father gifted her land in an area where the Picts held power. Additionally, it is worth noting that Nessa's son carried her name rather than his father's, regardless of whether that father was Cathbad or a mystical worm. His name was Concobar mac Nessa, which translates to \"son of Nessa\"."
