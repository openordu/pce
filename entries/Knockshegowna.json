    "text": "In the rolling countryside of north Co. Tipperary, there is a mythical place called Knockshegowna (Cnoc S\u00eddhe \u00dana). This area with a plethora of tales about enchanted Fairy Mounds has an impressive hill, believed to be the S\u00eddhe or palace of \u00dana, an Irish Fairy Queen. According to the legend, one evening, \u00dana appeared there as a calf when she was irritated by a piper named Laurence Hoolahan continuously playing his drunken tunes. She spoke to him in human language, which surprised him, and he easily mounted her back. Within a second, they flew through the air and landed at the River Shannon, which was ten miles away. Surprisingly, the piper was not terrified, which surprised \u00dana, but she, impressed with his bravery, allowed him to continue playing on the hillside for as long as he wished. It is possible that the story is based on the hill's name being misinterpreted as Fairy Calf Hill."
