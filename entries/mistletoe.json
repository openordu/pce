    "text": "An evergreen parasitic plant, Viscum album, known as mistletoe, has retained its ancient symbolic power even in today's era. This plant grows on deciduous trees and shrubs. It is said that the British tradition of placing a sprig of mistletoe in the home at the winter holidays, which dates back to pre-Christian religion, is still popular in England and America. Generally, kissing rituals take place under the mistletoe. It is believed that the associations of mistletoe with pre-Christian religion are so strong that it is not used in church decorations as it was believed to be sacrilegious to bring it into the church. The Roman author Pliny the Elder has mentioned the mistletoe as the most sacred plant of the Druids. This plant was especially valued when it grew on an Oak tree that was sacred to the Celtic priesthood. Pliny elaborated that the plant was harvested after a ritual banquet, precisely on the sixth day after the new moon. After cutting down the mistletoe with a golden sickle, two white bulls with bound horns were led to the mistletoe-bearing tree and slaughtered. Thus, a mistletoe harvested under these circumstances was named \u201call-heal\u201d and was believed to have powerful medicinal properties that could cure barrenness and impotence, as well as serve as a remedy for poisons."
