    "text": "The Fynnodderee, a character in Manx folklore, was known as the \"hairy one\" of the Isle of Man due to his long, shaggy hair. He had a fondness for human women, to the point that he was expelled from the Otherworld for neglecting Fairy dances in his pursuit of non-fairy maidens. As a result, he wandered without a fixed abode and was neither entirely of this world nor the other. Despite his isolated existence, however, he showed kindness to humans and could be as helpful as a Brownie."
