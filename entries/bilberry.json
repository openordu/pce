    "text": "Vaccinium myrtillus, commonly known as bilberry, mulberry or whortleberry, holds a symbolic significance. This berry served as an important calendar marker in Ireland and still holds relevance today. During the Celtic summer feast of Lughnasa, the climbing of hills to retrieve bilberries was a celebrated festival, which involved the consumption of the freshly picked berries or using them to create pies and wine. It was believed that the bilberries would lose their flavor after Lughnasa. The season of bilberry was considered the start of the harvest and many predictions were made based on the number of berries produced by the bushes. The abundance of berries predicted a good harvest ahead, whereas the scarcity of berries indicated the threat of hunger."
