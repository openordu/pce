    "text": "A Munster princess of the seventh century C.E., Decca (Deoca), is known for her role in the mythological tale of the Children of Lir, which is one of the Three Sorrows of Ireland. She married the king of Connacht, and during her reign, heard a story about enchanted, singing swans that consisted of four brothers and a maiden named Fionnuala. Despite their transformed bodies, the swans retained their human voices. Eager to see them, Decca demanded to do so, but her husband initially refused. She decided to leave him, which eventually changed his mind. He arranged for the swans to be brought to their palace. As the swans transformed back into humans, Decca was able to witness the enchantment but discovered they died of old age and turned to dust."
