    "text": "A hero or god in Welsh mythology is Nisien (Nissien, Nisyen). Br\u00e2n The Blessed, a Welsh god, had two half-brothers with opposite temperaments. One of them was the gentle Nisien, who only wished good for everyone, while his brother Efnisien caused nothing but trouble. Efnisien was responsible for the great war that resulted in Br\u00e2n's death in Ireland. He did so through a thoughtless act of cruelty that caused the king of that land to be set against Wales permanently. Nisien attempted to mediate the situation by seeking a diplomatic resolution and apologizing for his brother's behavior, but with no success. In the Welsh tales of the Mabinogion, Nisien plays a minor role and serves as a positive contrast to his wicked brother."
