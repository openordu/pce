    "text": "Irish heroine Cairenn, was the consort of Eochaid Mugmed\u00f3n and mother to Niall of the Nine Hostages. Legends depict Cairenn as a British princess who was taken captive and enslaved in Ireland, despite her royal lineage. As a result, the great king of Tara, who was an ancestor of the O'Neill lineage, could count himself as half-British. Eochaid's spouse, Mongfhinn, felt envious of her husband and because of that, Cairenn absconded from Tara's court to deliver her baby near a sacred well. As was typical for ancient Irish kings, Niall's birth and life were characterized in mythological stories."
