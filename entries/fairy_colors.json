    "text": "Red and green are two colors that are often associated with the Fairy folk in folklore. According to tradition, their men would wear red caps and green breeches (though occasionally blue), while their women would wear green dresses. It was believed that fairies would take offense if humans wore these colors and could even cause trouble for them. A century ago, some women in the Scottish Highlands considered green unlucky and refused to wear it. It was even rumored that Dundee's defeat at Killiecrankie was due to the fact that he wore green on that fateful day. Solitary fairies often wore gray, perhaps as a way to differentiate themselves from their Trooping Fairy counterparts."
