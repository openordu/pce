    "text": "Cl\u00eddna, also recorded as Cleena, Cl\u00edodna, Cliodna, Cl\u00edona and Clidna Centfind, is an Irish heroine or goddess who is believed to be associated with the ninth wave during every sequence of nine waves. This largest wave is named Tonn Cl\u00edodhna after the goddess who was acknowledged to be the most beautiful woman in the world, namely Cl\u00eddna of the Fair Hair. Within the southwestern province of Munster, Cl\u00eddna is particularly linked to the area and is sometimes known as its Fairy Queen, even though this title is also attributed to \u00c1ine and Aeval. Initially connected with the fairy hill located in Cork named Carrig Cliodna and the adjacent offshore rocks called Carrigcleena, it is reasonable to assume that, much like other fairy queens, she could have initially come from the land as a goddess. Cl\u00eddna is related to many romantic stories that have been recorded. One of them indicates that she was wooed by Ciabh\u00e1n, the womanizing outcast of the heroic squad called the Fianna, who succeeded in winning her hand in marriage in her home country of T\u00edr Tairngiri or the Land of Promise. In contrast to most human suitors of fairy women, Ciabh\u00e1n was able to travel freely between this world and the Otherworld. When he went hunting on the mainland of Ireland, he brought Cl\u00eddna with him to Glandore or the \"Golden Harbour.\" As Cl\u00eddna took a nap in their boat, her lover disembarked. However, a massive wave flipped over the boat, causing the beautiful Cl\u00eddna to drown. Despite this account of her demise, Cl\u00eddna went on to live and experience more romantic escapades. She fell in love with a man named John Fitzjames, who was already involved with a human lover named Caitileen \u00d3g. Caitileen \u00d3g followed Cl\u00eddna into the Otherworld and angrily demanded the return of her lover. The charm and wit of Caitileen \u00d3g fell short in convincing Cl\u00eddna from letting her lover go, despite coming close to succeeding. Cl\u00eddna had romantic relationships with notable Irish families, such as Earl Gerald Fitzgerald of the Desmond Geraldines, who was the son of fairy queen \u00c1ine, and Caomh, who was an ancestor of the O\u2019Keeffes. Banshee Cl\u00e1dna was also associated with the MacCarthys and shared with them the secret of the Blarney Stone, a belief that touching it with one's lips grants eloquence; a superstition upheld to these modern times. Cl\u00eddna's affiliation with nobility hints that she could have been the goddess of the Sovereignty of sea-lapped Munster."
