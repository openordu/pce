    "text": "In Irish place-lore, the brother of Aige was known as the heroic figure named Faifne. Aige was a talented and respected maiden who unfortunately fell victim to the evil intention of Fairies who transformed her into a doe. Despite her valiant attempts to escape, she was relentlessly pursued and tragically lost her life at the hands of a minor king named Meilge who appeared to be against her family. As it was the duty of a Bard, Faifne cast a powerful Satire upon the king, which caused visible blemishes to appear on his skin and ultimately resulted in his loss of kingship, as seen in the story of the Blemished King. In retribution for this, Meilge's warriors took revenge on Faifne and killed him."
