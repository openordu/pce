    "text": "Irish deity Mac Cuill, deemed as a minor divinity, was the spouse of land goddess Banba. His name literally meant \"son of Holly,\" a plant symbolizing winter, which hints at his likely association with that season. Along with his brothers, Mac C\u00e9cht and Mac Gr\u00e9ine, who were also the partners of the remaining two significant land goddesses, he constituted a group of three gods who ran parallel to one another."
