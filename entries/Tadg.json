    "text": "A hero from Ireland by the name of Tadg (also spelled Tighe or Tadc) is a common figure in Irish history and mythology. The most renowned Tadg was Tadg mac Nuadat, who was the grandfather of the hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Scholars have speculated that Tadg's name is derived from the name of the god Nuada, despite his name implying that he was Nuada's son. Another Tadg, less well-known, was the foster father of Cormac Mac Airt, the great king of Tara. When Cormac was a child, he killed some Badgers and brought them home for dinner. His foster father, upon seeing their bloody appearance, refused to eat them. As it turned out, the Badgers were his Shape-Shifting cousins. A third Tadg was the son of the wise hero Ciabh\u00e1n who journeyed to the Otherworld to meet Cl\u00eddna, the beautiful Fairy Queen."
