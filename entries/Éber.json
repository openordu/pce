    "text": "An Irish hero named \u00c9ber (also spelled Eber and \u00c9bir) appears in the Book of Invasions alongside several other characters who share his name. It is believed that this name is derived from the biblical Book of Genesis, in which there is a similarly named character called Eber (also spelled Heber). \u00c9ber Finn, the most significant \u00c9ber in Irish mythology, was the leader of the Milesians and the son of the eponymous M\u00edl Despaine (also known as Mil of Spain or the Spanish soldier). He was granted half of the country, the southern part, after his people defeated the magical race, the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, while his brother \u00c9rem\u00f3n received the northern half. However, \u00c9ber felt that his portion of the country was smaller than \u00c9rem\u00f3n\u2019s, and he was unhappy with this division. In an unsuccessful war that \u00c9ber started against his brother, he was killed. \u00c9ber Donn, another character with the same name, was the envious older brother of \u00c9ber Finn. He played a minor role in Irish mythology and is often conflated with the king of death, Donn. These figures are often confused with each other and may have originally been a single character."
