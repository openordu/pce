    "text": "Irish mythology and popular folklore has long been fascinated with the enigmatic Sheela na Gig (also known interchangeably as Sheela-na-gig, Sheila na Gig, S\u00edle na gig, Sheela Ny Gig, S\u00edle na gC\u00edoch). Often carved into rocks, this potent figure defiantly presents herself with a lewd smile on her face, a skeletal appearance, exposed buttocks, seemingly sunken or non-existent breasts, bent knees, and an exposed vaginal opening. Once present across Irish and British villages, these carvings have been largely incorporated into the gargoyles of Christian buildings, predominantly churches (often above entrances), with a few found in other structures such as mills and castles. \n\u00a0\nThe promiscuous nature of these female figures attracted the attention of the scholars in the 19th century. The prudishness of the era, however, meant that some Sheela na Gigs were often wrongly identified (in one instance, as a male fool holding his heart open) or misinterpreted as dirty jokes. Some believed they were of pagan origin, ancient goddesses appropriated by the Christian church to gain compliance from her followers. Although, some experts suggest that these figures date back only to the Christian Middle Ages and represent Christian iconography. But the pervasive question remains: What does the Sheela na Gig truly represent? \n\u00a0\nConcerns of lust and warnings against it are often associated with the Sheela na Gig, but there has been a recent shift towards connections with the Hag goddess present in folklore. Her name has variously been translated as \u201chag,\u201d a coarse term for female genitalia, as well as \u201cthe holy lady.\u201d While some think of her as a Fertility figure, the toothy grin and genitalia on display are confounded by the seemingly ancient quality of the figure, perhaps further illustrated by the lack of prominent breasts. A practice to promote fertility and safe childbirth involved the use of rock scrapings from the Sheela's vulva. Generally, the Sheela's location above doors is interpreted as apotropaic, intended to ward off evil. This interpretation is further supported by folklore which suggests that revealing one's genitals is a way for women to drive away evil. Some figures, however, are located lower in walls and show evidence of continuous touching in the genital area, perhaps for good luck or healing purposes. In Co. Kerry, a ritual still exists that involves touching a Sheela with a handkerchief on the saint's feast day. Despite the Sheelas being dated to the Christian era, pagan antecedents have been found. Some figures suggest the Sheela's posture and exaggerated features may derive from an ancient divinity, probably a goddess. The appearance of skeletal hags in Irish myth suggests a connection to the multiform goddess of Sovereignty or to the pre-Celtic divinity called the Cailleach. In Britain and Ireland, several dozen Sheela figures remain in their original positions, while others can be found in museums. However, evidence suggests that hundreds more once existed and were destroyed, either due to prudery or a need to use the stone elsewhere. A topic of ongoing debate concerns the origins and meaning of the Sheela na Gig. Some argue that the figure originates from Celtic tradition, while others posit it as a relic of pre-Celtic times. Still others claim that it represents a Christian notion of the uncleanliness of female anatomy. Despite the uncertainties surrounding its origins, contemporary feminist artists in regions with Celtic heritage have embraced the Sheela na Gig as a visual representation of female empowerment."
