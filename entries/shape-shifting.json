    "text": "In Celtic myth and folklore, the concept of shape-shifting is a prevalent and intriguing one. It often relates to the abilities of the Bards and Druids, who were said to be capable of changing their appearance while maintaining their core essence. The Milesian poet Amairgin, for instance, described his various transformations in a long poem upon arriving in Ireland, identifying himself as a \"wave of the sea, a Salmon in a pool,\" among other shapes. Similarly, the Irish Tuan Mac Cairill and the Welsh Taliesin are credited with composing similar lists of transformations. Although it is possible to interpret these poems as descriptions of natural phenomena, the fact that each line begins with \"I am\" suggests that the speaker remains in some way connected to their animal form. Legends also feature stories of individuals who undergo sudden transformation. Often, these changes are the result of enchantment, such as when Sadb, the mother of poet Ois\u00edn, was turned into a deer. Others, like \u00c9tain and Midir, chose to shift into the forms of swans, intending to mate for eternity as the birds do. Some transformations are for the purpose of hiding or escaping, such as when Cian transformed himself into a pig to evade the Sons Of Tuireann. Of course, other transformations carry a punishment or curse, as was the case for the evil A\u00edfe, who was turned into a crane as payment for cursing Fionnuala and her brothers to become swans for nine centuries. Clearly, the notion of shape-shifting once played a significant role in Celtic culture and mythology. Shapeshifting was a skill most fairies were believed to possess, although Spriggans and other smaller breeds were said to be limited to one form. Monstrous fairy races like the Water Horse morphed their shape to inflict harm. In an instant, a beautiful youth could become a murderous equine. Some argue that fairies did not actually change form but projected a Glamour, causing onlookers to perceive them differently without changing themselves. To witnesses, the difference would be irrelevant. The ability to change shapes at will was attributed to Witches in folklore, typically in the guise of an ordinary animal, often a Hare. Their aim was to sneak about stealing Milk and Butter, driving Cattle crazy, and causing trouble. Originally a magical act illustrating the druid\u2019s control over the physical world, it had degenerated in folklore to local mischief."
