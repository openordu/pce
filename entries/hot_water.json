    "text": "In Irish folklore, there is a motif regarding hot water. It was believed that throwing hot water outside at night could potentially harm the Fairy folk who lingered in the farmyards during the after-hours. In the absence of drains in cottage kitchens, the housewife would pour the cooking and cleaning water onto the courtyard stones in order to clean up the yard with used water. To prevent any unobserved humans from accidentally getting drenched, crying out warnings directed towards the fairies to be careful of the boiling splash (\"Towards ye! Towards ye!\") would also have been helpful."
