    "text": "Ciabh\u00e1n, the Irish hero also known as Keevan of the Curling Locks or Ciabhan, was once a member of the Fianna, a group of heroes led by Fionn Mac Cumhaill. However, he was expelled from the group after being known for his womanizing tendencies. He went on to venture towards the Land of Promise, T\u00edr Tairngiri, where he displayed his impressive juggling skills. It was there that the fairy queen Cl\u00eddna took him as her lover, but their affair led to her untimely death. She perished while waiting for his return from a hunting trip."
