    "text": "In the islands located off the coast of Scotland lies a folkloric figure known as Henky. According to the folklore, Fairy people in the regions of Orkney and the Shetlands could be identified by the way they danced with a limp, which is also known as \"henked.\" However, the reason behind this physical disability has not been explained in the tales. This is why the name Henky became commonplace to refer to a fairy person in that area."
