    "text": "Cernunnos, a Celtic god, was among the most prominent and ancient deities of the Celts, with evidence of his name and image being present among both continental and insular peoples dating back to the fourth century B.C.E. While his name appears in just one inscription from France, the meaning of \"the horned one,\" has been controversial as it comes from iconographic, not linguistic sources. The image of the horned god, however, is found elsewhere including on the significant Gundestrup Cauldron. The horns Cernunnos dons are not from domesticated animals, but rather they are those of a stag, hinting at his connection to the powers of the wildwood. He is also linked to the seasonal cycle, as deer sprout antlers in the spring and shed them in the fall. In almost all known images, he is accompanied by animals, both wild and domesticated, thus making him known as the Master of Animals. Often, Cernunnos bears or wears a Torc, a symbol of high status and holiness. He could have signified a force of abundance and prosperity because he is usually depicted alongside symbols of plenty like the cornucopia and the moneybag. While there are no records of his myths, his image remains prevalent to this day as the horned devil image is thought to have originated from him."
