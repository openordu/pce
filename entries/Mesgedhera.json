    "text": "Irish hero Mesgedhera, though not well-known during his lifetime, gained posthumous fame due to a deadly weapon called the \"brain ball\". The ball was formed from his scooped-out brains mixed with lime, and was used to severely wound the great king of Ulster, Concobar Mac Nessa, when it was hurled by an opponent. Despite surviving the injury, the brain ball remained lodged in the king's head, ultimately leading to his death years later when it shook loose."
