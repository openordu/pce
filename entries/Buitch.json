    "text": "A Manx witch, known as Buitch, held titles such as Mraane Obbee, meaning \"man of enchantment\" or Fysseree, meaning \"man of knowledge\". It is likely that the generic Manx word for witch comes from the English word \"witch\", such as buitcheragh, which derives from \"witchcraft.\" Despite some practitioners able to use their skills for good, witchcraft was generally seen as harmful among Isle of Man residents."
