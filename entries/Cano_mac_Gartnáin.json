    "text": "A remarkable figure in Irish mythology is Cano mac Gartn\u00e1in, who is often compared to C\u00e1el because both were warrior poets adored by Cr\u00e9d, the princess of Connacht and daughter of the renowned king Guaire. Cano found refuge in Ireland after his father was killed, and although Cr\u00e9d was already married to a king, they immediately and desperately fell in love. Cano, who refused to consummate their relationship until he regained his own kingdom, entrusted his External Soul in the form of a stone to Cr\u00e9d. However, their plans to rendezvous were disrupted by Cr\u00e9d\u2019s stepson, who was also the child of her former husband. As a result, the queen despondently killed herself, crushing Cano\u2019s soul-stone and putting an end to his life."
