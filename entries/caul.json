    "text": "An interesting folkloric motif exists where infants are born with a veil of skin, commonly called a caul, that covers their faces. In various cultures, this occurrence is considered to distinguish the child in some way. In Celtic territories, the caul often implies access to Otherworld knowledge. On the Isle of Man, where the sea surrounds the land, it is believed that a child born with a caul is blessed, as they will never drown, becoming popular fishing companions who will eventually wear or carry the preserved caul as a charm against the sea's storms. In Ireland, the caul was referred to as the \"cap of happiness\" and preserved as a symbol of good fortune."
