    "text": "Crimthann Nia N\u00e1ir, son of Lugaidh Riab nDerg who was known as the striped man, was born to Clothra. Interestingly, Clothra was both his grandmother and his mother, making their relationship incestuous. It is believed that Clothra\u2019s status as the goddess of Sovereignty, married to all the kings of her land, draws a parallel to the incest motif. Crimthann Nia N\u00e1ir met his end during the battle of the Intoxication Of The Ulstermen, along with his formidable foster mother Richis, who was a satirist."
