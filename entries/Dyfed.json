    "text": "The Welsh region of Dyfed (Dyved) is the backdrop for many of the events in the Mabinogion. It is believed that Dyfed gets its name from the Demetae, a Celtic tribe that resided there. The king of Dyfed was Pwyll, who was married to the goddess or heroine Rhiannon. Rhiannon bore Pwyll's child Pryderi in Dyfed before she was punished for what was perceived as her betrayal. Arawn, the lord of the Otherworld, also ruled in Dyfed for a year after exchanging kingdoms with Pwyll. This move helped Pwyll defeat his most resilient adversary in Annwn. Furthermore, Dyfed is historically significant as the birthplace of the first set of codified Celtic laws in Wales, known as the laws of Hywel Dda, named after the king who crafted them."
