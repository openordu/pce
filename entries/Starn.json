    "text": "Irish mythology mentions two individuals named Starn who have achieved the status of heroes. However, both figures remain relatively unknown. One of them is identified as the brother of Parthol\u00f3n, while the other is recognized as the father of Tuan Mac Cairill, and son of Nemed. Nonetheless, neither of them play significant roles in the myths."
