    "text": "A striking feature in Irish mythology is the ball seirc motif. It was a charming \u201clove spot\u201d on the forehead or sometimes on the shoulder of the handsome hero Diarmait. This dimple or mark made him irresistible to women, which often led him to wear bangs or a cap to cover it up. Diarmait's fortune changed when he exposed the ball seirc whilst trying to overpower some dogs. At that moment, the heroine Gr\u00e1inne fell under its spell and tricked him into taking her away."
