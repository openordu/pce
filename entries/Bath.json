    "text": "A British mythological site of note is Bath. The hot Springs at Bath, a southwest England town, have reputedly possessed restorative powers for two thousand years. Though there are some who speculate that the springs had been utilized prior to the Celts' arrival, all the information we possess of Aquae Sulis (Bath's Roman designation) comes from the Celtic era. Sul, the Celtic deity who presided over the location, was merged with the curative Minerva by the Romans who constructed the colonnaded temples and indoor bathing facilities that are still in existence today. The Celtic practice of tossing coins into bodies of water was observed at Bath, as was the custom of engraving curses onto sheets of lead. Here, 16,000 coins and more than 50 cursing tables have been found through excavations."
