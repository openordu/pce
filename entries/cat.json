    "text": "The animal known as the cat holds a place within folklore. During ancient times in Ireland, the land was inhabited by wild cats much like the cougar or mountain lion. It is believed that the pre-Celtic people of the Megalithic Civilization held the cat in high regard, as shown by the discovery of a cat buried near the great chamber of Fourknocks, potentially indicating a religious rite. While the larger, ancient Celtic cats no longer exist, their image lives on through myth and legend. Additionally, a smaller breed of wild cat, the Scottish wild cat, can still be found in the northern region of Scotland. Possessing glowing eyes, impressive physical flexibility and agility, cats were thought to seek out the company of old women with magical abilities, also known as Witches. On the Isle of Man, all cats were considered unlucky, whereas in Ireland, black cats were to be avoided except in cases where their blood was required for certain healing rituals. In Scotland, black cats were believed to be Shape-Shifting witches, which may explain the origins of some common symbols found within American Hallowe\u2019en traditions. The longstanding fear of black cats, as well as their association with witches and Hallowe\u2019en, may originate from Celtic culture; however, some individuals claim the association stretches back to the Greek goddess of witchcraft, Hecate, who was likewise connected to cats. Metaphysical rituals involving cats have been performed to foretell the future. Divination by the killing of cats was a practice observed in Scotland. In addition, both cats and witches were credited with the ability to manipulate or predict weather patterns. For instance, when a cat cleaned its face, rain would be expected; when it abandoned the warmth of a fire, a storm was viewed as imminent. Cats were often viewed with caution and discomfort, as evidenced by the common Irish greeting, \u201cGod bless all here except the cat.\u201d Despite this, cats are associated with several important mythological sites. However, little is known about the mythology behind these names. In County Roscommon in Ireland, there is a cave known as Oweynagat, or the Cave of the Cats. It is believed to open into the Otherworld, although it is unclear whether this is the same cave referenced in a divination rite involving a spectral cat. Another mythical site is found in Scotland's Black Wood of Chesthill, where a tall megalith called Clach Taghairm nan Cat, or \u201cthe stone of the devil cat,\u201d was the gathering place for Hallowe\u2019en celebrations by cats. Cats also appear in a number of Celtic tales and are often associated with the Otherworld. In the tale of the Voyage of Maelduin, a magical island is discovered where a single cat lives in a magnificent palace. However, when one of the hero's companions attempts to steal from the island, the cat shape-shifts into an arrow and brings down the thief. Perhaps the most famous legend about supernatural cats comes from Ireland, where it is said that Seanch\u00e1n Toirp\u00e9ist, the land\u2019s chief Bard, once became disgusted when mice walked upon the banquet table and stuck their whiskers in the egg he was about to eat. A Satire was composed by an individual who was inspired to mock the Irish cats, along with their high king, for their inability to keep the island free from mice. The king of cats, Irusan, who was situated in his palace at the Br\u00fa Na B\u00f3inne, magically overheard the satire and grew twice his size due to his fury at being insulted. He managed to journey across the land and catch hold of the poet with the intention of devouring him. However, when they arrived at the abbey of Clonmacnoise, where the saints Kieran and Dunstan were occupied with metalwork (see Smith), the plan was thwarted. The saints threw metal rods at the enraged cat, who relinquished the horrified poet and vanished."
