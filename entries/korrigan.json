    "text": "Breton folklore is rife with tales of the korrigan, also known as the corrigan or ozeganned. These mythical beings are said to live in the sea, rivers, and springs, and are often depicted as beautiful, golden-haired women who seek to lure men to their deaths by drowning. While similar myths can be found in many regions of the world, the Breton version stands out for the connection between the korrigan and ancient beliefs in earth goddesses and female druids. According to oral tradition, the korrigan are descendants of these women, and their loyalties lie with the old ways. Indeed, Christianity's suppression of these beliefs led to a lasting enmity between the korrigan and the celibate priests who represented the new religion. In Breton folklore, the korrigan are responsible for building the magnificent city of Ys, and are tied to woodland grottoes and running streams, where they might sometimes be coaxed into revealing the future. However, seeking them out is not without risk, for the korrigan, like all fairies, were said to be amoral, and could just as easily steal a person or a child as impart a piece of knowledge. Some legends suggest that the korrigan were once human, trapped by a tragic death to wander the earth, but more commonly, they are seen as a race apart from humans \u2013 indeed, in Breton, the term is often used to refer to fairies in general. It is said that Korrigans are more visible in odd-numbered centuries than in even-numbered ones. For example, the 1900s saw more activity from these mythical beings than the 2000s. Typically observed during twilight hours, they are known to be liminal creatures. Some Korrigans act as guardians of buried treasure, while others prefer to create mischief for humans. They have been known to tickle horses and cause nightmares. Korrigans derive immense delight from circle dances that take place within, or close to, pre-Celtic Stone Circles and megalithic shrines still found in Brittany. The lyrics to their songs go \u201cMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday\u201d (Di Lun, Di Merh, Di Merhier...), but they never mention the days of the weekend, as this is said to cause magical deformation such as a lump on the back."
