    "text": "An Irish heroine named Emer, also known as Eimher or Emer Foltcha\u00edn, has been held up as an embodiment of ideal womanhood for nearly two thousand years due to her possession of six key attributes: a beautiful voice, eloquent speech, physical attractiveness, wisdom, chastity, and proficiency in needlework. Emer became the wife of the symbol of masculinity, the great hero C\u00fachulainn - although their nuptials were not expedited as they both would have liked. C\u00fachulainn found himself a popular object of desire amongst the women of the court of Ulster's king, Concobar Mac Nessa. Fearing scandal, the king sent his men out to find a perfect bride for C\u00fachulainn, hoping marriage would quell the women's ardour (it did not). After a fruitless year and a day, C\u00fachulainn himself set out to find his ideal match. Emer was suggested to be a suitable prospect as she was Forgall Manach's daughter who was admired for her wisdom and beauty. Upon his arrival at Forgall's household, C\u00fachulainn discovered Emer instructing all the women in needlework. They exchanged a series of riddles, with Emer demonstrating her wit and intelligence. She informed C\u00fachulainn that she was a virginal and fair 'Tara among women' who was not to be trifled with. Without preamble, Emer and C\u00fachulainn fell deeply in love, though Forgall put two obstacles in their path. The first concerned Emer\u2019s elder sister Fial, who was unmarried\u2014a situation beyond C\u00fachulainn\u2019s control. However, the second issue, his lack of adequate training in the \u201cmanly arts,\u201d could be addressed. C\u00fachulainn journeyed to Scotland to learn from the renowned Sc\u00e1thach, a Warrior Woman. Emer pledged herself to him during their separation, but he did not hold true to his promise. After a brief time, he fathered a child with Sc\u00e1thach\u2019s daughter (or sister, or likeness), \u00c1ife. Despite this, Emer maintained fidelity. The Ulster Cycle, in which Emer features, was recorded by Christian monks, who may have reinterpreted her character as a model of Christian behavior for women. In earlier Celtic mythology, goddesses were capricious in their relations with human kings and women were just as ready to act on their desires as men. Whether the figure of Emer derived from a former goddess or was always human is unclear. Upon his return from Scotland, C\u00fachulainn presumed he would marry Emer. However, Forgall still refused to consent and incarcerated him at Lusca (now Lusk, Co. Dublin). But C\u00fachulainn made use of the lessons learned from Sc\u00e1thach and, with a great leap, escaped captivity and slew several dozen men along the way. Emer's husband, C\u00fachulainn, left with her and other treasures after Forgal's fatal leap. Among the treasures were several carts laden with gold and silver. C\u00fachulainn, as was his way before their marriage, continued to take lovers as he pleased. Emer, however, was aware of her own value and never became envious of any woman that her husband slept with. There was a single instance in which Emer was worried, involving Fand who was one of the greatest of the Fairy queens and the wife of the sea god, Manann\u00e1n Mac Lir. When C\u00fachulainn left with Fand, Emer fretted for a month, before deciding to potentially murder Fand. Ready to kill, she hid nearby where C\u00fachulainn and Fand were enjoying illicit intimacy. But upon seeing the beauty of their love-making, Emer could not end either of their lives. Fand, realizing how much Emer loved her husband, gave up and went back to the Otherworld. The human couple drank a potion of forgetfulness. Emer stayed devoted to C\u00fachulainn until the very end and died with him on the Pillar Stone where he stood upright awaiting his last battle."
