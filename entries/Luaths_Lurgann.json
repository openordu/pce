    "text": "Luaths Lurgann, an Irish heroine, was known for her incredible speed - a trait that earned her name, which means \"speedy foot.\" As a Midwife, Lurgann helped deliver her nephew, Fionn Mac Cumhaill, who would grow up to become a highly regarded hero in his own right. Fearing for Fionn's safety from those envious of his potential, Luaths Lurgann took on the task of training him in martial arts in her forest home. Fionn was deeply devoted to his aunt; unfortunately, he accidentally caused her death while fleeing from an enemy. In an effort to save Luaths Lurgann, Fionn picked her up and ran at such great speed that the wind tore through her body, leaving behind only her thighbones. These bones were then used by Fionn to dig a lake, now known as Loch Lurgann."
