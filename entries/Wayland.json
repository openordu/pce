    "text": "Wayland or Wieland is a hero of British folklore and mythology who, like the Irish figure Goban Saor, is believed to be a remnant of a mythological character. The ancient Celts and Germans regarded blacksmiths as magical beings with abilities beyond those of the common man. It is unclear whether the name of the smith in British legend and folklore was influenced by one or both of these cultures. The story of Wayland's lameness was likely borrowed from the Mediterranean, where the god of smiths, Vulcan, was often portrayed as a cripple. According to legend, Wayland was crippled by Nithland, a legendary king of the Niars, to trap him at his forge. To avenge himself, Wayland killed the king's son and raped his daughter. Wayland was renowned for his exceptional craftsmanship, creating powerful weapons such as Excalibur, the sword wielded by King Arthur."
