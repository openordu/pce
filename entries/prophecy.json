    "text": "Religious ritual plays a significant role in the practice of prophecy. Unlike omens, which are unsolicited, prophecies result from specific rituals performed to obtain knowledge about future events. Interpretation of omens, such as a bird's flight, was a learned skill among the Celtic priestly Druids. On the other hand, initiates courted prophecy through a variety of ritual techniques that resulted in a trance or altered state, allowing for glimpses into hidden matters. Prophecy, a specialized form of divination, enables early visions of the future, while divination could also involve uncovering long-hidden secrets of the past and present. For instance, divination could identify a criminal while prophecy could predict if they would be caught. The Celts have used both prophecy and divination since ancient times. According to Diodoros of Sicily and Strabo, Human Sacrifice - possibly of prisoners or criminals - was used to disclose the future, with a victim's dying moments decoded to reveal upcoming events. In Ireland, several complicated rituals of prophecy and divination existed, including the Imbas Forosnai or chanting into the fingertips and the tarhbfleis, which involved a druid or poet sleeping inside the hide of a freshly killed bull to dream about the future, specifically regarding the future king's identity. A folkloric motif involves protection against fairies. Fairies were not necessarily malevolent creatures, but rather they were amoral and did not adhere to humanity's moral and ethical standards. Therefore, safeguarding against them was not equivalent to warding off wickedness, as they were more often than not merely mischievous pranksters rather than nefarious foes. Commonly, they sought to mislead travelers (see Pixy-Led, Stray Sod), which could be a minor inconvenience and even terrifying, but even without protection, the fairy lost interest in the game and let go of the ensnared human. On a more serious note, fairies endeavored to allure useful or comely individuals into the Otherworld to fulfill their desires until released. Musicians were in big demand to play for the never-ending fairy dances; midwives were useful to deliver fairy babies, and attractive people of both genders were sought after for amorous dalliances. Since time passed more slowly in Fairyland than in this world, spending a single day there could equate to spending a lifetime here; when returning, one might discover that loved ones had passed away, and the world was utterly different. What is even worse, the returnee might find this world so drab and lifeless in comparison to the wonders of fairyland that death would soon follow. Thus, it was established as conventional knowledge that people should carry protection against fairies when embarking on even short journeys; in fact, even a brief hike could result in difficulties, so it was a good idea to fill one's pockets with bread or salt. The fairies avoided Christian objects, so crosses and holy water were useful sources of protection. Iron was also loathsome to fairies, so carrying a knife, scissors, or nail in one's pocket as well as hanging a horseshoe over the entryways to houses and barns was considered good advice. Plants such as Shamrocks or four-leaf clovers, daisies, St. John's wort, and red verbena contained properties useful in breaking fairy enchantments. Rowan or mountain ash was especially effective as the fairies could not tolerate its berries. Additional actions could also break fairy spells, including wearing clothing inside out or backwards, as well as singing, praying aloud, or whistling. Leaping over streams could provide protection against fairies as they were believed to be frightened by running water. However, this protection only held true if there were no other fairies standing on the opposite shore."
