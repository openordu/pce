    "text": "In Celtic Ireland, the goddess of the land was known as Sovereignty (also spelled Sovranty or Lady of Sovereignty) and was commonly depicted as the bride of the king, symbolically wedded to him during his inauguration. Despite the varying figures associated with Sovereignty, such as the unnamed hag who offered Niall a drink at her well and demanded a kiss in return, \u00c9riu, the goddess of the island or the strong and determined Medb, who married numerous kings, they all embody the same concept - that it is the duty of the king to maintain the land's fertility through just ruling. This obligation involves offering hospitality to all, leadership that is wise, and respecting the sacred vows and taboos that accompany his position, such as Buada and Geis. If the king does not do these things, his rule could be relinquished or, like Conaire, who did not honor his word, could result in his death. A hag who visits the king to proclaim his death, as in the case of Conaire, may be a form of the punitive Sovereignty goddess. Additional information can be found under Kingship."
