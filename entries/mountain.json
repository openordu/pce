    "text": "A significant symbol in the cosmology of the Celts was the mountain. While the Celts revered everything in nature as sacred, specific places were considered to be the abode of divine power. Mountains and hills, along with wells and river sources, were believed to be important foci of this power, which was often portrayed as having a feminine aspect. The Cailleach, a figure associated with high hills in Scotland and Ireland, is believed to have pre-dated the arrival of the Celts, suggesting that mountain worship may have been a part of early Irish culture. In Ireland, mountains also held political and royal significance. They provided an advantageous view of the surrounding land, rendering them valuable to defenders in case of an assault. The Hill of Tara, though not a dominant mountain in its landscape, offered a breathtaking view of the surrounding countryside. Additionally, the nearby Uisneach mountain became the mystical center of the island, as its summit provided a panoramic view of peaks in nearly every region of Ireland."
