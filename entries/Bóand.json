    "text": "An Irish goddess known as B\u00f3and (Boann, B\u00f3nn, Boinn, B\u00f3inn, Boadan; possibly Bouvinda) is featured in this piece. The name B\u00f3and means \u201cwoman of white cows\u201d or \u201cshining cow,\u201d but the Cow itself isn't present in her tale, unless she's the same as B\u00f3 Find, the ancestor of all cows in Ireland. B\u00f3and might also be the same goddess known as Bouvinda by the Egyptian geographer Ptolemy, a name that associates B\u00f3and with other cow goddesses in the Indo-European tradition. The River Boyne, on which Ireland\u2019s remarkable ancient monuments sit, was named after her. Like many of Ireland's river goddesses, B\u00f3and is said to have visited a forbidden Well, lifted the stone that guarded it, and was thus drowned by the well's waters as they rose, in the process creating the river. This well goes by the name the well of Seg\u00e1is, which was B\u00f3and's name in the Otherworld. A further illustration of the identification of the two names is that the Boyne is also known as Sruth Segsa, meaning \u201criver of Seg\u00e1is\u201d. B\u00f3and is connected with wisdom and is seen as a goddess of knowledge; one derivation of her name means both \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cwisdom.\u201d Folklore suggests that she lost her sight as a result of the flooding river, indicating a shared connection between inner vision and outer blindness. She is also related to the well-known inhabitant of the river source, the one-eyed Salmon commonly referred to as Fintan, through the motif of the single Eye. In Irish tradition, it was believed that if a person drank from B\u00f3and\u2019s river in June, they would gain the power of prophecy and become a poet. Finally, as Celtic rivers were seen as sources of abundance and prosperity, B\u00f3and is also associated with wealth and prosperity. Goddess B\u00f3and is associated with the solar year, being the deity of the remarkable mounds of Newgrange-Br\u00fa Na B\u00f3inne, which is referred to as the \"palace of B\u00f3and\" in the Irish language, making it the most prominent winter Solstice location in Ireland. This is where she met the good deity Dagda and was compelled to betray her husband Nechtan (also known as Nuada, or Elcmar in some versions of the story). In order to keep their wrongdoing under wraps, Dagda intervened and prevented the sun from moving for nine months so that B\u00f3and could bear their son, Aonghus \u00d3g, without Nechtan ever realizing that more than a day had passed. It is noteworthy that in several variations of this story, B\u00f3and goes by the name of Eithne."
