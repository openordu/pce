    "text": "The pooka is a character found in Irish folklore known as p\u00faca or phouka. Welsh legends refer to it as pwca and in England, it was known as pouke or puck. The pooka is a spectral figure with varying descriptions, sometimes appearing as a white horse or black dog, while other times, it takes on the form of a goat. It is believed that the pooka may have originated from the Danes, as they have a similar character called Puk\u00ed. The Welsh pwca appears in the form of Robin Goodfellow or Puck, a half-goat mischief maker, as seen in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. In Britain, the puck was a shape-shifter who usually appeared in human form. Although the pooka could be friendly, often assisting farmers who treated it kindly, like in the story of the boy who made friends with a pooka and ended up with several living in his barn, it never accepted payment. If offered compensation, the pooka disappeared. It was also believed that the pooka was a sign of ill-fortune, often signaling that bad luck was imminent. According to one legend, a man was attacked by a pooka in the form of a goat, and although he suffered from intense pain for three weeks, no visible mark from the attack was found. In the famous story of the Pooka of Kildare, the being appeared as a donkey, but as soon as it was given clothing, it vanished. The pooka's description and behavior varied across legends, but it remained an intriguing and mysterious figure. After Samhain, the Celtic festival marking the beginning of winter on November 1, the pooka was prone to attacking, and some believed it caused plants to wither during the season. Its method of attack involved taking its victims for a wild ride through the air in its horse form, leaving them far from their starting point, gripped with terror. The southwestern province of Munster was the Irish epicentre of pooka appearances. Castle Pooka, situated near Doneraile where Edmund Spenser wrote The Faerie Queene, was supposedly haunted by one, Carrig-a-Phooka, a rock located west of the small market town of Macroom, was a frequent visitation site, and Melaam, an island close to Kenmare, heard frightening noises allegedly produced by the pooka during storms and dark nights. Flann O\u2019Brien's (Brian O'Nolan) modern Irish comic novel At Swim-Two-Birds features a significant appearance of the pooka."
