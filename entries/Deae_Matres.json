    "text": "Continental Celtic goddesses known as Deae Matres were revered as the \"Divine Mothers\". This Latin name is given to one of the most prevalent depictions of goddesses found in Celtic territories. Often represented as sculptures, these divine mothers are sometimes portrayed as two figures, but commonly as three which was a significant number for the Celts. They are usually depicted as seated and may vary in age - young maiden, fertile mother, aging crone - or even as identical triplets. Their hands hold sacred objects such as a sacrificial knife, Patera which is an offering plate, foodstuffs, bread, and fish. As many Celtic gods and goddesses were associated with the fertility of the land and the prosperity of the people, the Deae Matres were also linked to food and abundance. Besides the commonly known figure Dea Nutrix, meaning the nourishing goddess, the triple goddesses could also be portrayed in the form of a single voluptuous woman holding symbols of fertility, known as the \"pseudo-Venus\" or false Venus. There is no historical information regarding the ritual practices associated with these goddesses, and it appears that they were absorbed into the Roman religious customs during the imperial era."
