    "text": "A Celtic tradition known as the Law of the Innocents is one of the oldest and still-existing laws in Scotland. This law provided protection for unarmed civilians during times of warfare. Adomn\u00e1n, a Christian cleric and ninth abbot of Iona, wrote the law around 700 C.E. He included a provision that penalized men who committed rape during war. Scholars have examined this element of the law and have debated the role that Celtic society played in putting women at risk with its focus on warfare. However, there are others who contend that women in Celtic regions had considerable authority before the arrival of the Saxons and Vikings and the spread of Christianity, which led to a decline in their power. Regardless, the Law of the Innocents was utilized in the late 1990s by three women who dismantled a Trident submarine control center in Scotland as a protest against nuclear arms. Unanimously acquitted by the jury after an order from Judge Margaret Gimblett, the women's defense relied on this ancient law."
