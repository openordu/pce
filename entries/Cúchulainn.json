    "text": "Irish legend boasts a mighty hero named C\u00fachulainn (also Cuhullin, C\u00fa Chulainn, or Cuchullin) who has no equal in strength or renown, even though the great Fionn Mac Cumhaill comes close. The Ulster Cycle features C\u00fachulainn most prominently and tells the tale of his magical birth. When his mother, Dechtire, drank water with a worm in it, C\u00fachulainn was born. This same story of magical conception applies to C\u00fachulainn\u2019s king, Concobar Mac Nessa, who is C\u00fachulainn\u2019s mythic double. Concobar was either Dechtire\u2019s father or brother, and rumors spread that Dechtire was pregnant with an incestuous child when she began to show. Dechtire married but was ashamed, causing C\u00fachulainn to be born prematurely. Nonetheless, he lived, bearing the name of S\u00e9tanta. All of Ireland\u2019s heroes contended for the privilege of fostering the brilliant young man, which prompted Dechtire to request that each instead offer a special gift. As a result, C\u00fachulainn received the finest treasures that ancient Ireland had to offer: the poetry of Amairgin, the eloquence of Sencha, and the wealth of Bla\u00ed Briuga. The valiant Fergus Mac R\u00f3ich served as his teacher in the manly arts, while kindhearted Findch\u00f3em nurtured him. Conall Cernach was his foster brother, and Concobar, his foster father. Variant narratives suggest that C\u00fachulainn was Sualtaim Mac Roich\u2019s son, an Ulster chieftain otherwise unknown who typically fills the role of his foster father or that he was conceived by the god Lugh when Dechtire was in the enchanted form of a bird. In all of the tales, however, C\u00fachulainn reveals his warrior nature early on, challenging boys at the Emain Macha court when he was only five years old to a contest with child-size weapons, which he won easily. King Concobar ventured to Cuailnge, a place that would later prove to have a significant influence on the life of C\u00fachulainn, leaving behind the young S\u00e9tanta who was occupied with playing. S\u00e9tanta caught up with the royal party at Smith Culann's house, guarded by a ferocious dog that C\u00fachulainn killed with ease in order to enter. Although the host detested this mindless killing, the dignified seven-year-old vowed to serve as Culann\u2019s hound until he found a suitable replacement. Thus the boy earned his adult name, for C\u00fa indicates hound, and the hero became known as \"the hound of Culann\" from then on. The next time we hear of the young hero, he grew irate with his hurling companions, and killed them all with a strike to the head, becoming practically unrecognizable due to the ferocity of his rage. He marched back to Concobar\u2019s fortress while still seething with anger, and when he fought, he went into what was known as the \u201cwarp-spasm,\u201d with one eye sinking into his skull while the other bulged out, and blood and light rays emanating from his head. It required numerous huge containers of water to douse his fury. The time arrived for C\u00fachulainn to court a woman when he reached maturity, and he chose the lovely Emer, who possessed all the finest qualities of womanhood, just as he did of manhood. Emer\u2019s father, Forgall Manach, did not consent to the match, and dispatched C\u00fachulainn on what he believed to be a senseless errand: to learn from the Warrior Woman Sc\u00e1thach in Scotland. C\u00fachulainn persuaded the accomplished warrior to teach him her secrets, which are similar to the remarkable feats seen in martial-arts movies today. An outstanding technique that appears to be his own creation was the Salmon-leap, a type of playful pounce that rendered C\u00fachulainn practically invincible in combat. In spite of his pledge to stay true to Emer, his intended spouse, while in Scotland, C\u00fachulainn had a brief affair with the warrior A\u00edfe, who bore him a son. When the boy had grown into a young man, A\u00edfe bequeathed C\u00fachulainn\u2019s ring to him and dispatched him to Ireland. The lad declined to reveal his identity to his father, and thus C\u00fachulainn unknowingly killed Connla. Despite tying the knot with Emer in the end, C\u00fachulainn had multiple infidelities, among them one with the fairy queen Fand, who lured him away from human existence. None of these dalliances, however, led to another child. C\u00fachulainn\u2019s most celebrated exploit was his solitary defense of Concobar\u2019s Ulster against the invasion initiated by queen Medb to steal the cattle. His primary weapon was his spear, G\u00e1e Bulga. Being a non-Ulsterman, C\u00fachulainn did not experience the weakness caused by Macha's dying curse, wherein the men of Ulster would suffer pain similar to childbirth for four days and five nights every time their territory was attacked. While the Ulstermen were agonizing, C\u00fachulainn repelled one hero after another, slaying them all in individual combat, including his dear foster brother Ferdiad. (For a complete account of C\u00fachulainn\u2019s exploits in that epic battle, examine T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge.) He violated his Geis or sacred vow never to consume dog meat and died. Several tales related to his death exist in ancient texts, but one fact remains constant: he refused to meet his demise in any other way than standing. Chained to a pillar, C\u00fachulainn endured a barrage of javelins and other weapons even after his death, only being officially declared gone when the carrion Crows, servants of the goddess Badb, swooped down to peck at his eyes. C\u00fachulainn's legend has continued to inspire a wealth of literature since his heroic era. W.B. Yeats channeled the hero in several plays such as The Only Jealousy of Emer, depicting his affair with the fairy queen Fand, and On Baile\u2019s Strand, delving into his accidental killing of his only son. Morgan Llywelyn's historical novel Red Branch offers further insight into the mythology of C\u00fachulainn."
