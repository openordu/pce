    "text": "A condition known as \"stroke\" or \"elf-stroke\" was believed to be caused by punishment from the Fairies in the past. The full or partial paralysis that we now understand is caused by an interruption of blood to the brain or a clot therein, was thought to be the result of being \"stroked\" by the Fairies as a form of punishment. Offenders who fell into a coma were believed to have been taken Away and replaced by Changelings. According to the superstition, interfering with Fairy Trees, plowing through Fairy Mounds, or any other disruption of their business could lead to a stroke. As a result of this belief, many sites of legendary importance were preserved for generations."
