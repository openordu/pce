    "text": "British folklore describes a rural tradition of walking the boundaries of parishes on certain holidays, known as beating the bounds. This ritual, which persisted until recent times, was headed by a priest or minister, though its origins are thought to be pre-Christian. The procession included passing by ancient Standing Stones where children were pushed against the boulders, as well as dunking children in sacred springs or ponds along the route."
