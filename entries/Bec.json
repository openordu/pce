    "text": "Bec, a name meaning \"small,\" is attributed to a number of figures in Irish mythology who are considered heroes. Bec mac Buain, for example, was the father of the maidens who protected a Well of magical significance, and it was when one of these guardians mistakenly spilled some water from the Well into Fionn Mac Cumhaill's mouth that the hero gained wisdom. Bec mac D\u00e9, on the other hand, was renowned for his divinatory abilities; he was able to deliver a single answer that simultaneously addressed nine different questions."
