    "text": "There existed a Scottish folkloric figure known as the feolagan, which was notorious for causing trouble for sheepherders. The feolagan was said to be a dangerous and hard-to-catch fairy, especially on the Hebrides islands\u2014particularly around Kebock Head on the Isle of Lewis. Unlike most fairies, the feolagan was larger and paralyzed sheep simply by crawling across their backs. Once immobilized, the sheep were unable to eat or drink and eventually died. To break the spell of the feolagan, one had to capture the fairy and force it to walk across the sheep's back once again, but in the opposite direction - this was the only way to ensure the paralysis was lifted. It was crucial that the feolagan who had caused the trouble be captured because attempting the cure with the wrong fairy may lead to more harm than good. When a large group of sheep was affected, the person responsible could imprison the mischievous feolagan in a jar of salt. The salt contained grains that could be used to cure the sheep."
