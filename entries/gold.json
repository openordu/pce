    "text": "Symbolic metal, gold held great value among the Celts, who earned recognition for their expertise in metalworks. However, gold's worth was not only tied to commerce, but also to myths. It represented prosperity through the summer's abundant vegetation, as it was associated with the Sun. Personal ornamentation, such as the Torcs, which were neck-rings made of twisted gold, were some of the exquisite treasures of the ancient Celtic crafts. Even the golden Boat discovered in Broighter Bog was a ritual object that showed the significance of gold to both insular and Continental Celts. As per ancient authors, the Celts held gold in high regard. Diodorus Siculus pointed out that the Celts had a peculiar custom that involved offering a significant amount of gold in the temples and sanctuaries they dedicated to the gods. The gold was displayed openly, and it was not stolen, as it would attract terrible misfortune. This tradition still exists today, like the Irish and British placing coins in sacred places, which typically remain untouched. The Celts also associated gold with Goddess and Fairy Queen, who were known to possess long golden hair like that of \u00c1ine and \u00c9tain, who used a golden comb to comb it. The lights of FairyLAND were also said to be golden, and human desire for this metal could be allured by the apparent wealth of gold found there. But stolen pockets full of the metal would turn out to be nothing but the butter-colored flowers of the Gorse when the thief returned to earth. Following the decline of Celtic religion, the magical substance was reduced to being simply money in an inferior form. The treasure of the goddess and leprechauns who were sought for their pot of gold were transformed into the \"Money Hole\" of Munster- a place with unlimited money, lost somewhere on the Loughfennel mountain slopes. It was believed that thistles grew at locations where fairy gold was buried."
