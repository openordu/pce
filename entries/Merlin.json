    "text": "A hero of Arthurian legends, Merlin (also known as Myrddin, Myrdinn, Merddyn, Merddin, and Merlinus) is the most famous character after the love triangle between Lancelot, Guinevere, and King Arthur. Merlin was behind the scenes of the throne and was responsible for the creation and maintenance of Camelot. Even before Arthur built his citadel, Merlin contributed to Britain's architectural history by erecting Stonehenge on Salisbury plain. Merlin demonstrated his abilities at an early stage of his life. He was chosen to become a foundation sacrifice - a human sacrifice that was offered to stabilize a new building's foundation and protect it through his death from shifts in the earth that could damage the structure. However, he saved himself by going into a visionary trance and uttering an extended prophecy about the land's future rulers and challenges. Merlin's vision was centered on a great dragon that he saw in the foundation hole. This dragon ultimately led him to envision the greatest king the land would ever know, Arthur. Without Merlin's assistance, Arthur would never have come into existence as he transformed Uthur PENDragon to look like count Gorlois of Cornwall to conceive Arthur with Gorlois's wife, the loyal and beautiful Igraine. Gorlois was killed by Uther Pendragon, and Uther took Igraine as his new wife. Arthur became eligible to claim his inheritance, and it was Merlin who guided him to a sword lodged in a gigantic stone. This sword, which should not be mistaken for the magical Excalibur given to Arthur later on by the mystical Lady of the Lake, was unnamed. It saved Arthur from harm during combat. Only the rightful king could remove the sword from its rocky prison, and although many had tried, none had been successful. However, Arthur released the sword with one tug, and in so doing, uncovered his destiny - something Merlin had known all along. Merlin was Arthur's trusted advisor and closest confidante when the Knights of the Round Table pursued glory in Camelot's joyful years. Despite Merlin's ability to perform magic, he either failed to realize or could not stop Camelot's power and influence from dwindling or Arthur's ultimate downfall. Merlin himself did not perish; he lives on in another world where he was ensnared by Viviane, his lover, who was a fairy queen or a sorceress (sometimes called Morgan). There are various suggestions as to why Viviane trapped Merlin, using the very spells he had taught her. For example, some tales suggest that she was afraid he might be drawn to other women, while others propose that she wished to ensure his immortality. Using his sorcery, she trapped him inside a tower or a colossal tree in the magical Broc\u00e9liande forest, where he remains to this day, unable to move and powerless. The legendary character of literature conceals the ghost of a previous, perhaps divine, figure named Myrdinn. After him, the island of Britain was known as Clas Myrdinn, or \"Myrdinn's enclosure.\" As per Welsh accounts, Myrdinn was originally a warrior who lost his mind (possibly due to being Myrdinn Wyllt, a kindred spirit) after witnessing the horrors of the Arfderydd battle. He then fled to Scotland, where he meditated until he acquired the power of anticipating the future. Myrdinn, the deity worshipped at Stonehenge as the Sun divinity, is a subject of contention as some assert that the deity was male instead of female. However, this is an unproven assumption. It is said that when Christianity arrived, Myrdinn took the treasures of the land and nine Bards and retired to an island off Wales."
