    "text": "A practice in Irish ritual known as c\u00e9tnad was implemented by Bards. They used this practice to locate stolen property, specifically cattle, by chanting through their hands. The Bards also performed a special chant, directed at the seven Daughters of the Sea, to determine an individual's lifespan."
