    "text": "A mysterious character in Irish mythology, Elcmar is considered a god or hero. His existence is linked to the renowned site of Br\u00fa Na B\u00f3inne, a prehistoric structure located on the banks of the River Boyne in central Ireland. Legends mention him as being married to the River goddess B\u00f3and, also referred to as Eithne in some accounts, who betrayed him with the Dagda. Some versions of the tale state that B\u00f3and's spouse was Nechtan or Nuada instead of Elcmar. At the birth of their son, Aonghus \u00d3g, the young child used a charm during a feast hosted by his father to oust Elcmar from the Br\u00fa. This charm was the same one used to drive the mythical race Fir Bolg from Ireland by the Tuatha D\u00e9, who were subsequently defeated by the Milesians and forced into the Otherworld."
