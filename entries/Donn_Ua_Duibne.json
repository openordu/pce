    "text": "Donn Ua Duibne, or Donn O\u2019Duin, also known as Donn \u00d3 Duibhne, is a legendary beast in Irish mythology. Although it appeared to be a wild boar that killed the romantic hero Diarmait Ua Duibne, it was actually a shape-shifting human. This wild boar was actually Diarmait's half-brother, who was born from his mother Cochrann and her lover, a shepherd. Donn, Diarmait's father, found out about the affair and killed the infant by crushing it. However, the child's father knew magic and was able to bring him back to life, but as a wild pig. Donn, seeking vengeance, lived only to exact revenge on Diarmait. When they crossed paths on the hill of Ben Bulben, Donn knew he had his chance. Though Donn lost his life to Diarmait, he was able to pierce the hero with one of his needle-sharp whiskers, and Diarmait bled to death."
