    "text": "Tuan mac Cairill, an Irish hero and brother of the early Irish invader Parthol\u00f3n, is believed to have survived the plague that wiped out his people and continued to live on in various forms. These forms included that of a Stag, a Boar and an Eagle which he assumed after each reincarnation. Later, Tuan turned into a Salmon that got eaten up by a woman, who then became pregnant (refer to Pregnancy Through Drinking, Eating). Tuan was then reborn as a human and remarkably remembered all his past lives. This ability earned him the reputation of being a great and eloquent Bard. In Wales, a similar story was narrated about a boy named Gwion, who was reborn as the bard Taliesin after getting eaten by the goddess Ceridwen while Shape-Shifting. Tuan was the one who recounted the mythological history of Ireland known as the Book Of Invasions. He bore the authority to do so as he had witnessed a significant part of Irish history. Certain texts speculate that Tuan and Fintan, the salmon of Wisdom, were the same."
