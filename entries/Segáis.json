    "text": "A site and goddess from Irish mythology is Seg\u00e1is (Segais). In the story of B\u00f3and, the goddess of the River Boyne, Seg\u00e1is was the name given to the secret Well of wisdom. It was also referred to as Connla\u2019s Well, although it is believed that the two sites may have been different. Despite warnings, B\u00f3and decided to journey to the well, which was said to be located in the mountains of Slieve Bloom by some while others believed it was the source of the Boyne itself that was in Co. Kildare near Edenderry. Like other mystical wells, it had the ability to bestow wisdom upon anyone who drank from it or consumed the fish swimming in its waters. As B\u00f3and approached the well, the water rose up suddenly and drowned her, carrying her out to sea. The waters of the well, which represents the origin of two of Ireland's important rivers, could never go back to the small space of the well, and the river flowed and watered the land. Similarly, a similar story is told about S\u00ednann, the goddess of the River Shannon. As such, both stories are often used to discourage women from seeking wisdom, but they can also be seen as creation myths. B\u00f3and herself was also named Seg\u00e1is. According to the Dindshenchas, a collection of place-poetry of Ireland, she was known as Seg\u00e1is in the Otherworld, and the other name for the Boyne was \"river of Seg\u00e1is.\" This suggests that if the well were initially in B\u00f3and's possession, rather than her husband Nechtan's possession, her death by drowning may have been an act of creation rather than punishment."
