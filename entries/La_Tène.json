    "text": "During the La T\u00e8ne Period in Celtic culture, an exceptional discovery was made by amateur explorers in 1858. Located in the region of La T\u00e8ne, meaning \"the shallows\" in Switzerland's Lake Neuch\u00e2tel, a colossal deposit of items was found. These objects, ranging from golden Torcs to iron Cauldrons, and from intricate silver brooches to sacrificed Dogs, Pigs, and Cattle, were seemingly discarded in the lake as part of a religious ritual. The horde gave its name to the third period of Celtic culture, while the earlier periods were the Urnfield and Hallstatt. The La T\u00e8ne period is now categorized further into three phases: I, II, and III. The metal ornaments discovered in the horde, which are rich in spirals and whorling designs, exemplify high-quality creations of ancient art. A group of artisans living along the lake created the art found in the horde. Old European designs, including those pre-dating the Indo-European influence, are found in the La T\u00e8ne art, as well as Greek, Etruscan, Scythian, and even Persian designs, suggesting that the La T\u00e8ne people participated in a broad network of cultural exchange in the Mediterranean region. Although the artists of La T\u00e8ne were active only between approximately 500 B.C.E. and 100 C.E., their style continued until the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169."
