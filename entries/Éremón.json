    "text": "An Irish hero named \u00c9rem\u00f3n (also known as Heremon or Eremon) emerged as a leader of the Milesians. According to the Book of Invasions, the Milesians were the final group of invaders to arrive in Ireland. The mythical story tells how \u00c9rem\u00f3n and his brother, \u00c9ber Finn, fought against the magical forces of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann for control of the island and won. The event is believed to be rooted in a historical memory of a final wave of Celts who came to Ireland and overtook the earlier Celtic and non-Celtic peoples who lived there. However, after the victory, the two brothers disagreed on who should rule the land. Wise poet Amairgin intervened and divided the territory in two, along the low glacial hills stretching from present-day Dublin to Galway, known as the Eiscir Riada. \u00c9rem\u00f3n was given the north, while \u00c9ber Finn received the south. Despite this, \u00c9ber Finn remained dissatisfied and waged an unrelenting war against his brother until \u00c9rem\u00f3n was eventually forced to kill him. Following this, \u00c9rem\u00f3n became king of a united Ireland and established the kingship at Tara, which he named after his wife, T\u00e9a."
