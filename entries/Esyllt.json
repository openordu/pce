    "text": "Esyllt (Essellt), a Welsh heroine, was said to be the original inspiration for the romantic figure of Arthurian legend, Iseult. She was known as the wife of King March, who later became King Mark in the Arthurian cycle, and was also the lover of his nephew Trystan, who similarly became known as Tristan. Her name derives from the phrase \"the one gazed upon\" and may have Germanic rather than Celtic origins. Despite this, the tale of Esyllt's elopement with a young man, leaving behind her aging husband, has roots in Celtic myths of the Sovereignty goddess."
