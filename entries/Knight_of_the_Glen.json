    "text": "The Knight of the Glen, also known as O\u2019Donohue of the Glen, was a figure in Irish folklore. Daniel O\u2019Donohue, the Fairy king of the upper lake of Killarney in Munster, was said to be this mythical character. Among the many tales told about him, there's one where he bewitched a log to look like a local man named John Connors, while he took the actual man to sleep in the Otherworld. The enchanted log was waked and buried with great ceremony and mourning, while the real John remained in FairyLAND asleep. When John finally woke up and returned home, his family and friends were terrified and were barely convinced that he was not a ghost."
