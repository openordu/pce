    "text": "There was an Irish heroine named \u00c9is \u00c9nchenn (also known as Ess Euchenn). When the great hero C\u00fachulainn went to Isle of Skye in Scotland to learn martial arts from a woman warrior named Sc\u00e1thach, he had to contend with three strong men who were no match for him. C\u00fachulainn beheaded them and continued his journey. On his way back, he had to traverse a narrow road running alongside an abyss. While doing that, he came across a fragile hag who requested him to move over and let her pass. However, since there was space only for a single traveler on the road, C\u00fachulainn hung out over the abyss, keeping his balance only by his toes. \u00c9is \u00c9nchenn, who was the mother of the warriors Bir, Blicne, and Ciri, the ones that C\u00fachulainn had killed, happened to be that crone. Instead of passing gracefully, she stomped on C\u00fachulainn's hands, hoping to send him tumbling to his demise. However, C\u00fachulainn executed his famous Salmon-leap and beheaded \u00c9is \u00c9nchenn, killing her."
