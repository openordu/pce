    "text": "A symbolic plant known as bile (bele; pl., bili) is often seen near a sacred Well or other honored site in Ireland. It is decorated with offerings, specifically strips of cloth known as Clooties, even to this day. Historically, bile would have marked an Inauguration site, with its branches providing the wood for the king's scepter. A god named Bile is also present in Irish mythology and is recognized as the ancestral father to the Milesians, who were the last group of invaders to Ireland. It remains uncertain whether the tree and god are interconnected. In ancient times, indications suggested that Bile was an underworld divinity due to its representation of the unification of the underworld (roots) and upper world (branches). Bile was utilized as a term to indicate a sacred tree or any genus, though specific kinds of trees such as Oak, Yew, and Ash were believed to possess extraordinary powers. The Dindshenchas, which are Irish place-poems, describe five great trees of ancient Ireland. One of them being an oak that bore nuts and apples alongside acorns, replicating the trees believed to have grown in the Otherworld. The Yew of Ross was the second sacred tree, described as a \"firm strong god,\" while the remaining three were ash trees, with the most notable being the mythic Ash of Uisneach that stretched 50 miles across the countryside when felled. The ancient Celts may have also believed in ancestral tree-spirits, in addition to having totem animals. Ancient Irish groups with names like Fir Bile, meaning \"tribe of the sacred tree,\" or the Continental Eburones, known as the \"yew-tree tribe,\" further support this idea. Sacred trees held immense significance among the Celts and were strictly forbidden to be cut down, a custom that endured even after the advent of Christianity. At the oak of Brigit in Kildare, weapons were prohibited, possibly because of the tree\u2019s sacredness before the construction of a convent at the site; the town's name includes the words for church and oak. Although the folklore associated with sanctified trees survived until recently, it conveyed the respect accorded to them for millennia. For instance, in an Irish village, Borrisokane, the burning of the town's holy tree's branch was believed to result in the destruction of the perpetrator's house. This reverence for trees is one of the most fundamental Celtic beliefs. The Celts conducted their rituals in sacred groves, Nemetons, which were desecrated by the Romans, an irreparable loss to the populace, likewise Christianity's assertion that trees should not be venerated with prayers or offerings. Nonetheless, despite heavy fines, Celtic tree-worship continued, and the church's repeated denunciations of this practice, for generations, are evidence of its persistence. Martin of Tours, famous for destroying idols, failed to gain access to a sacred pine tree in central France, which suggests the intensity of devotion to it. The Church, confronted with such profound devotion, transformed the trees with their adherents, declaring them sacred to the Virgin Mary or minor saints, decking them with saints' images and, using them as Christian ritual sites."
