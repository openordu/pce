    "text": "Irish heroine Fionnuala, also known as Finola, Finnguala, Fionguala, Finnuala, and Fionnula, is the subject of one of the most popular Irish myths. She was the daughter of King Lir and his first wife \u00c1eb, who was the daughter of the magician Bodb Derg. Fionnuala and her twin brother \u00c1ed were born to a happy couple, but tragedy struck when \u00c1eb passed away during childbirth of their second set of twin sons, Fiachra and Conn. Lir, hoping to make a happy home for his motherless children, married his wife\u2019s foster sister A\u00edfe who was jealous of the children and plotted against them. She convinced Lir that she was ill and needed her foster father\u2019s attention, taking the children to Bodb Derg\u2019s home in the west. However, along the way, she transformed them into swans and cursed them to remain so for 900 years. Despite Bodb Derg\u2019s magic, the enchantment couldn't be undone. The Children of Lir were left as swans with human emotions and voices to sing of their woes. For 300 years, they lived on Lough Derravaragh in central Ireland, then another 300 years on the frigid Sea of Moyle to the north, and finally on an island off Co. Mayo. The enchantment finally wore off, but the years caught up with them instantly, and they aged, died, and turned to dust. They were buried in the old way, standing upright in the grave."
