    "text": "A legendary figure in Arthurian lore is Elaine, also known as Elayne, Elain, or Elane. The most well-known iteration of Elaine is the Lady of Shalott, also known as Elaine of Astolat. She was cursed and held captive in a room where she wove magnificent tapestries that allowed her to see the outside world without leaving the castle. One of her tapestries depicted a handsome knight, and Elaine fell deeply in love with him. Despite the knowledge that her love would be her undoing, Elaine set off in a boat for Camelot to be with the object of her desire, Lancelot. She died on the way due to her unwavering love for him. Sir Thomas Malory's Morte D'Arthur was the first to tell this powerfully evocative tale, but it is likely derived from earlier Celtic legends. It is speculated that the original Elaine could have been the siren of Scotland's Clyde River, who lived in a castle on the rock of Dumbarton, where she used a magic mirror to see everything that was happening in the world. This mirror has been interpreted as the river itself, whose reflective surface could be \"cracked\" by storms. Elaine's story may be connected to the Welsh Fairy Elen. Another version of Elaine was the mother of Galahad, Lancelot's son, and a woman with whom Lancelot had an affair. She was the daughter of the Fisher King and arranged for Lancelot to be tricked into thinking that he was sleeping with Guinevere to preserve his purity despite his physical infidelity. Lastly, Elaine of Garlot, Arthur's half-sister, played a minor role in the Arthurian legends. Unlike her sisters Morgan and Morgause, who turned against Arthur due to their mother's deception, Elaine married one of Arthur's enemies, Nentres, and formed an alliance with King Arthur."
