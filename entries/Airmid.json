    "text": "A goddess of Irish myth, Airmid was a member of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, a tribe led by the goddess Danu. She was also an herbalist and the daughter of Dian C\u00e9cht, a divine physician. With her brother Miach, Airmid healed king Nuada's wounded hand, which was necessary for him to continue to reign since a king with a blemish could not lead the people. Dian C\u00e9cht had attempted to make a hand of silver, but his children did much better by making flesh grow around the prosthesis, creating a true-to-life limb.\n\nHowever, Dian C\u00e9cht became envious and killed Miach. Airmid tended her brother's grave and noticed hundreds of healing plants among the flowers, which she began to classify. Her father crept up on her, but he allowed her to finish her work before scattering all the herbs. Unfortunately, Airmid's order was never restored, and the ancient Irish claimed that the loss of her medical knowledge greatly increased the pain that humans must bear."
