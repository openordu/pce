    "text": "An Irish folkloric character named Eisirt existed in the Otherworld, which had Bards more potent than mortal poets, similar to Fairy Queens. He served as the most important poet for King Iubdan. Eisirt faced issues when he claimed that Giants occupied Ulster and was challenged to prove his statement. Upon his journey to Ulster, Eisirt returned with the court Dwarf, who was monstrous in comparison to fairy folks. This event fascinated King Iubdan, resulting in his travel to Ulster. During his visit, his tiny wife Bebo caught the attention of many males."
