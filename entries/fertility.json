    "text": "Fertility is a cosmological concept that holds great significance to those who live in close communion with the land. The prospect of barren land, empty herds, and unproductive rivers is particularly terrifying, as it can lead to famine and death. The Irish associated the fertility of the land with the king's virtue, believing that the goddess of the land's Sovereignty, who was also the king's spouse, would bear bountifully if the king was generous and honorable. Fertility was therefore not confined to either the feminine or masculine, but rather relied on a harmonious balance between the two. The Cornucopia and the Egg, symbols of abundance, were prevalent among both male and female deities among the continental Celts."
