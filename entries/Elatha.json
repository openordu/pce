    "text": "An Irish hero named Elatha (also known as Elada, Eladha, or Elotha) emerges from the early Irish texts, which describe the Fomorians as terrifying monsters who were the first inhabitants of Ireland. However, a few Fomorians were exceptions to this description and were even considered beautiful. Among these were Eithne, daughter of the Fomorian king Balor, and Elatha, a skilled and crafty king who mated with \u00c9riu, the land goddess of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, the people of \u00c9riu, ultimately displaced the Fomorians from their Irish lands. Although \u00c9riu was already married, she could not resist the charm of Elatha, who wore a golden-threaded cloak and had golden hair. In some variations of the story, it was Eithne who was gifted the embroidered cloak. \u00c9riu and Elatha's tryst led to the birth of their son Bres mac Elatha, who was not well-liked by the Tuatha D\u00e9. In a bid to seek help for their son, \u00c9riu turned to Elatha's people, which ultimately led to the famous battle of Mag Tuired. This battle resulted in the Fomorians being evicted from Ireland, as Bres, who was of half-Fomorian descent, was elected king and was deemed stingy and unreliable. The Tuatha D\u00e9 king Nuada ousted him. Some interpret these myths as reflecting the struggles between various waves of Celtic immigrants who had to fight for control against Ireland's earlier inhabitants."
