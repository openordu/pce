    "text": "Scottish and Irish folklore is rich with tales of sea fairies, known locally as \"na buchtogai\". These creatures are part of the Otherworld, the realm of the Fairies, who were said to reside not only beneath the hills and in bogs, but also on islands in the sea. Some of these islands were known to be shrouded in mist, while others would disappear entirely. Sea fairies often took the form of seals, just as their freshwater counterparts, the Swan Maidens, transformed into swans. According to folklore, marriages between water fairies and humans were common, with many coastal families claiming to be descendants of these unions."
