    "text": "One of the three sons of the primal goddess Danu was Iuchair (Iuchar), an Irish divinity. These three sons were known as the Sons of Tuireann and were given a series of tasks that were impossibly difficult after Cian, their father's enemy, was killed by them. Iuchar could have been an ancestral divinity, and similar to his brothers Brian and Iucharba, he may have been the father of Ecne, a divinity known for wisdom and inspiration. Due to the confusion that exists about the brothers in the tales, some scholars consider them as a triplication of a single figure. Others believe that they are identical with the three important Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann kings referred to as Mac Cuill, Mac C\u00e9cht, and Mac Gr\u00e9ine."
