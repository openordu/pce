    "text": "Irish legend tells of a renowned fairy ruler named Donn F\u00edrinne, who reigned over the magical Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. His palace, or S\u00eddhe, was nestled within the mountain of Knockfierna (also known as Cnoc F\u00edrinne) located in Co. Limerick. In local folklore, Donn F\u00edrinne was famous for abducting mortal women to join him in his fairy revelries. Given that these women were never again seen above ground, some speculate that Donn F\u00edrinne may have been linked to the enigmatic king of the dead in Irish myth known as Donn."
