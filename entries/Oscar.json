    "text": "A hero of both Scottish and Irish origin, Oscar (Osgar) was the son of the poet Ois\u00edn and his wife Eibhir, and grandson of the legendary warrior Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Following in his father\u2019s footsteps, Oscar joined the Fianna, a group of valiant fighters who battled alongside Fionn. His name translates to \u201cdeer lover,\u201d which pays tribute to his grandmother, Sadb, who was transformed into a deer through magic. Oscar, the fiercest of the Fianna warriors, led a group called \u201cthe terrible broom,\u201d named for their ability to sweep any battlefield clean. After the death of his grandfather, Oscar became the leader of the mighty band. Tragically, they were defeated in the battle of Gabhra, and Oscar met his demise at the hands of wounds inflicted during the fight. Following his death, his father Ois\u00edn bore him to the Otherworld, causing Oscar\u2019s wife Aid\u00edn to succumb to grief and weep herself to death."
