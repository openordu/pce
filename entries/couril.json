    "text": "The evil courils were a Breton folkloric figure, often found around ancient Stone Circles, specifically the ones at Tresmalonen, where they would dance throughout the night. If a human were to come across them in the dark, they would snatch them and force them to dance until they died from exhaustion. Alternatively, if the unfortunate victim happened to be a young woman, the courils would take advantage of her and leave her with a child who was half fairy."
