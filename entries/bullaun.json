    "text": "Round stones with holes in them found at holy wells and other sacred sites in Ireland, bullauns are considered as symbolic objects. They were believed to have healing powers, particularly assisting women who are trying to conceive or going through hard pregnancies. These stones were deemed as feminine symbols, similar to the yoni stones found in India. Large flat boulders with natural or artificial basins, possibly used as vessels for fluid offerings, or to ritualistically drink water were also used as bullauns."
