    "text": "The focus of this piece is on the seven Daughters of the Sea, who are considered to be Irish divinities. An incantation, known as C\u00e9tnad, was used to find out how long a person would live, and these goddesses were invoked in that process. \"I invoke the seven Daughters of the Sea,\" the incantation states, \"who fashion the threads of the sons of long life. May three deaths be taken from me! May three periods of age be granted to me! May seven waves of good fortune be dealt to me! Phantoms shall not harm me on my journey in flashing corslet, without hitch. My fame shall not perish. May old age come to me! Death shall not find me until I am old.\" While there is little information available about these goddesses, they may be associated with the Seven Sisters, after whom several holy wells and ancient stone circles in Ireland are named. Seven was a significant number in Ireland, although this sacredness may be due to the influence of Christianity, as the Celts typically regarded three and five as more sacred."
