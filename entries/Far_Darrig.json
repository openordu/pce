    "text": "Red is the color of Fairyland, which is the world inhabited by the Far Darrig (\"red man\"), an Irish folkloric figure. The Far Darrig was an annoying Fairy who enjoyed playing mischievous practical jokes that were appalling and cruel, even though he believed they were entertaining. He was quite short and ugly, and characteristically dressed in red. Refusing a request from the Far Darrig was considered unlucky, as he was imaginative in his punishments. When he sat by the fire, smoked his pipe, and thought, he would eat a meal left by a kind family, but disliked being spied upon. Having the Far Darrig in a house would bring good fortune."
