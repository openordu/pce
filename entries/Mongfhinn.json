    "text": "Mongfhinn, also known as Mongfhin and Mongfhionn, was an Irish heroine whose name was believed to ward off evil spirits. Despite her powerful name, Mongfhinn was not known for being particularly pleasant. She was either the stepmother or foster mother of Niall of the Nine Hostages, and she attempted to poison him. Unfortunately, Mongfhinn ended up taking her own life on the night of Samhain, which falls on November 1 and marks the beginning of winter. Interestingly, in certain parts of Ireland, this holiday was referred to as the Festival of Monghfinn. It is possible that Mongfhinn was once an important goddess, as her name includes the divine syllable \"fionn,\" meaning \"light,\" and women would pray to her on Samhain."
