    "text": "\u00c1ine, the goddess or Fairy Queen of southeastern Co. Limerick was referred to as Lair Derg, which means \"red mare\" in Irish. Given that horses were often associated with death and the color red was generally considered an Otherworldly color, the name appears to suggest that \u00c1ine is a goddess of death who takes people on a ride to the afterlife."
