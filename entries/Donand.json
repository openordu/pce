    "text": "Observed in the Book of Invasions as the mother of Irish heroes Brian, Iuchair, and Iucharba are Donand, an elusive Irish goddess. While some believe that Donand is the same as Danu, it is possible that she was a distinct goddess initially. Refer to Sons of Tuireann to learn more about Donand's sons."
