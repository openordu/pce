    "text": "Symbolic object, the mallet was a tool often carried by various Celtic gods, most notably by Sucellus. Some gods were depicted carrying a much larger form of the tool, commonly referred to as a mallet, which resembled a bat and held clear phallic symbolism. One such figure was the Irish god Dagda, who was famed for his enormous mallet, so large that he had to pull it around with a wheeled cart."
