    "text": "An\u00e9ra meic Conglinne, known as Mac Conglinne, was a hero of Ireland who appeared in a 12th-century Aisling poem. He was not a mythological figure, rather a character from Satire. Despite being a poor Bard from Co. Roscommon, he decided to embark on a Poet's Circuit throughout the Province of Munster. Upon hearing that the poets were well-treated, Mac Conglinne arrived in Cork but was not received with a warm welcome. Instead, he was made to stay in an unpleasant hovel that was infested with fleas and lice. Angered by the poor conditions, Mac Conglinne constructed a brutal satire that eventually led to him being condemn to death by crucifixion by the abbot. The night before his execution, he was shackled to a stone much like the great C\u00fachulainn. During his time in the cold and dark, an angel appeared to Mac Conglinne and recited a lengthy poem describing a land completely made up of food. This vision would allow the king afflicted with uncontrollable gluttony to recover. The next day, he insisted to be taken to the king, where he cooked haunches of meat before him while reciting the alluring and particular vision of the land of Milk and Honey revealed by the angel. This sight caused the sickly king to purge a demon from his mouth that hastily grabbed some of the food and disappeared. This satire melds together allusions to the ancient Celtic beliefs, the significance of being a poet, and the traditional motifs of appalling creatures that have the ability to take over human bodies."
