    "text": "Obscure in her worship, Berecynthia was a Continental Celtic goddess who was conveyed, as recounted by the early Christian author Gregory of Tours, in the form of a white-veiled image through the fields during springtime and whenever crops were at risk of failing. She is said to possibly be linked to Brigindo, another lesser-known Celtic Fertility goddess confined to a specific region. However, it is improbable that any depictions of Berecynthia exist today as most had been destroyed by Martin of Tours, Gregory\u2019s coreligionist, who had eradicated the majority of the \"pagan idols\" in the area."
