    "text": "An Irish hero named Roc was involved in the mythic tale of Diarmait and Gr\u00e1inne. In this story, Roc had an affair with the goddess Duibhne, who was the wife of a gloomy god named Donn. Duibhne gave birth to Roc's child, but when Donn found out, he became outraged and crushed the child's skull. However, Roc knew magic and was able to save the child's life by turning it into a great boar. The child grew to a monstrous size, lived on the mountain of Ben Bulben, and became known as Roc's pig. Though Duibhne returned to her husband Donn and had another child, Diarmait, Roc's pig would ultimately play a role in the tragic death of Diarmait at the hands of his half-brother."
