    "text": "The motif of stray sod (also known as lone sod or fod seachran) is a common theme in Irish folklore. While the typical scenario involves a Fairy using a Glamour spell to lure people away from their intended path, the fairy people in Ireland opted for a simpler approach. By placing a stray sod - a small, enchanted piece of grass - on the path, they could watch as unsuspecting travelers became disoriented and Pixy-Led. Even in the middle of a road, a stray sod could remain camouflaged. As soon as someone's foot made contact with it, their surroundings would become unfamiliar and confusing. Trapped in this way, the traveler could wander for hours, growing weaker and more exhausted until the fairy responsible for the mischief intervened and set things right again."
