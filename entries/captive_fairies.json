    "text": "There exists an Irish mythological theme surrounding captive fairies. Though it may prove to be a difficult task, some types of Fairies could potentially be ensnared under certain circumstances. Little Leprechauns could be caught by gripping their small shoulders, yet they often resorted to employing various forms of deception in order to escape; ultimately preventing their hidden stash of coveted Gold from falling into human hands. Fairy women who swam around earthly Lakes while disguising themselves as Swans, could be captured if an individual stole their swanskin robe resting nearby in the reeds at the lake's edge (see Swan-Maiden). Nonetheless, the robe had to be kept from the maiden's sight thereafter, because even if an apparently satisfied fairy wife bore numerous human children, should she reclaim her swanskin, she would vanish into the closest body of water. The same applied to Seal-wives or Silkies, whose skin robes also had to be carefully hidden. As a result, several well-known Irish families, such as the Coneellys and Flahertys, claim to have descended from captured seal-wives. For more information about captive fairies in a different context, refer to Fairy Kidnapping."
