With their sights set on the western horizon in search of the land of the sun, the brothers embarked on a perilous journey. Overcoming various hardships along the way, their resolve began to waver, except for that of Yvon, who persisted through obstacles until he finally discovered his sister living joyfully in the sun's abode. Upon his return home, Yvon was disheartened to find that ages had gone by and that all recollection of his kin had vanished from the land.
