The individual named Lugaidh mac Con Roí comes from the family of Cú Roí and is known as an adversary of Cúchulainn. In some accounts, he is referred to as the child of Bláthnat and holds a deep grudge against Cúchulainn since his mother betrayed his father for the very same champion. After delivering a deadly blow with a spear to Cúchulainn, Lugaidh conceded and permitted him to pass on with reverence before ultimately beheading the perishing hero as he propped himself against a standing stone. Following this, Lugaidh was confronted and killed by Conall Cernach.
