Water was a sacred element in Celtic religion, and lakes were considered to be powerful emblems of the Otherworld. Across many Celtic regions, the stories of cities existing beneath the lake waters (such as Inchiouin and Lough Ree) and magical creatures inhabiting either underneath the lake waves (like Lí Ban) or on mystical islands (like the Lady of the Lake) are well-known. The religious meaning of lakes as gateways to the Otherworld is believed to mirror ancient Celtic traditions of offering treasures to lakes. In Switzerland's Lake Neuchâtel, a significant hoard of items found in its shallows (La TÈNE) was likely a ritual deposit, put there to prevent illness or with an equally grave purpose. Meanwhile, holy Wells were commonly used for seasonal festivals, and lakes were more frequently visited for ritual purposes during times of immense need. Historical records indicate that an offering made to a lake near Toulouse in southern France preceded the end of a plague. However, the treasures were later stolen by the unreliable warrior Caepion. As a result, when he died in battle not long after, it was believed that he had received his due punishment for his greed. These kinds of legends played a huge role in protecting lake offerings from being pilfered, and recently, important and valuable artifacts were discovered in excavations at Lough Gur.
