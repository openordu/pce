Irish mythological site known as Lios, which typically refers to Hillforts and Stone Circles in Ireland, is famous for being the largest stone circle in the country, with a circumference of nearly 160 feet. Located close to the mythologically important Lough Gur, the enormous circle dates back to almost 4,000 years before the Celts' arrival in Ireland. As with numerous similar constructions, it is aligned astronomically, in this case, with the Midsummer moon's setting.
