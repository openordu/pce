Encountered amid a ride through the woods, Lorois was an Arthurian hero who stumbled upon a court of mounted women. These were beautiful damsels, adorned solely with flowers in their hair while riding beside their lovers astride strong horses. Following were a hundred thin women dressed in black, also on horseback, accompanied by thunder and snow as they rode. Trailing behind them for a distance were a hundred men of similar appearance. The first group of women had yielded themselves to love while the second had declined it.
