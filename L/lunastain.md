Scottish folklore holds a custom linked to the harvest feast of Lughnasa, a celebration around August 1 commonly observed in the Highlands and islands of Scotland. The people would bake a special cake called lunastain, alternatively known as luinean for men and luineag for women. It is believed that these cakes may have been created as offerings to appease the spirits or as enchanted sustenance to bring good fortune and ward off evil. A comparable cake, known as struan, was consumed during St. Michael's feast.
