Descended from Medb's own sister, Clothra, Lugaidh Riab nDerg, or Lugaigh of the Red Stripes, was conceived by three different brothers at once, and thus, bore the unique distinction of being the son of all three. Each part of his body that was sired by each of the brothers was demarcated by three red stripes that ran across his frame.
