Celtic mythology envisioned our world not as a standalone entity but rather interconnected with an Otherworld where entities such as spirits, Fairies and divinities reside. The Celts considered certain locations and timings as liminal, that is, places and situations that were not wholly of one kind, nor wholly of another kind – such as dawn, twilight, days of solstice and equinox, and regions like Bogs and Lakes and misty Islands. These liminal aspects were significant in Celtic myth and ceremony. During the Samhain and Beltane festivals, celebrated on November 1 and May 1, respectively, the Otherworld was believed to cross over into our world. Twilight visits near a Fairy Mound on these two powerful days could intensify the liminal forces and potentially invite Fairy Kidnapping.
