The fierce warrior woman Lot was a heroic figure from the otherworldly Fomorian people. She bravely led her people into battle against their foes, the people of Partholón. Like many of her kind, she was believed to be unattractive, with peculiar features such as lips on her breasts and four eyes on her back. In Arthurian legend, Lot or Lotha was a minor hero who married Morgause, King Arthur's half-sister, and fathered Gawain, one of the knights of the Round Table. Though Lot played a small role, his legacy through his sons was significant as they continued their feud with the sons of King Pellinore, whom Lot had fallen to during Arthur's battle for the throne.
