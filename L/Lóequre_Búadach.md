Lóequre Búadach was an Irish hero and a minor character in the story of the feast of Briccriu. The concept of the Otherworld, a cosmological location, was associated with him. The Celtic Otherworld was a place where gods, the Fairy people, and the dead resided. It did not exist above or below our earth unlike the Christian notion of heaven and hell. Instead, it was a parallel universe, which was not entirely separate from ours but could not be found within it either. The Otherworld was accessible through portals in either time or space, a concept known as liminality. Samhain on November 1 and Beltane on May 1 were believed to be periods when this world was exposed to the Otherworld. Borderland locations, such as bogs and islands, served as portals between these two worlds. Time functioned differently in the Otherworld, and one night spent there could translate to a hundred years on earth upon return.
