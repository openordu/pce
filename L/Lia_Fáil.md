The Lia Fáil, also known as the Stone of Destiny, is one of the four great magical objects of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the people of the goddess Danu in Irish mythology. This great stone pillar was said to have come from the Otherworld, specifically from the magical city of Fálias. It was believed to have stood on the great hill of Tara in Ireland and was used during Inauguration ceremonies of the High King. Legend has it that the true Lia Fáil would scream when touched by the rightful king. The other magical objects of the Tuatha Dé came from three other different Otherworld cities and included a spear that never missed, an invincible sword, and an inexhaustible cauldron. Despite its importance, there is some speculation about the true identity of the Lia Fáil that currently stands on Tara hill. Many legends claim that the true Lia Fáil has long resided in the Otherworld after being taken there when its owners were banished from the surface world. As per other legends, the true Lia Fáil now lies in Scotland. In the year 600 C.E., Tara's king loaned the Lia Fáil to his Scottish brother, who then refused to return it, and eventually became the Stone of Scone. The English king Edward I took the stone after the fall of Macbeth in 1057 and put it under the throne at Westminster Abbey, where it served for many years as the Inauguration Stone and the official symbol of authorization for the English monarchs. However, records suggest that it did not scream like the original Lia Fáil. Scotland attempted to retrieve the stone multiple times before it was finally returned in 1996. Some individuals argue that the Stone of Scone is not identical to the Irish Lia Fáil but originates from Egypt. This legendary stone was considered to be enchanted, as it had been sanctified in ancient times when Jacob from the Bible slept on it and envisioned angels climbing to the heavens.
