On Windover Hill in East Sussex, there is a British folkloric site known as the Long Man, or Long Man of Wilmington. It features a massive figure of a man, holding two staffs, etched into the white chalk soil. The figure's height reaches 226 feet, surpassing even the Cerne Abbas Giant, though it lacks the latter's impressive genitalia. The origin of the Long Man remains a mystery, but some speculate that it could depict an unknown Celtic god or a pre-Celtic people. According to local legend, the shape of the Long Man was outlined over the body of a real giant after pilgrims killed him on the hillside. This tale may allude to Christian opposition, which could have led to the emasculation of the figure.
