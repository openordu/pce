A god of Continental Celtic and British origin, Leucetius (Loucetius, Leucetius) has been identified from a handful of inscriptions located in continental Gaul and Britain. While records are limited, it is known that Leucetius was the consort of a famed goddess of sacred groves called Nemetona. Interestingly, an inscription found at Bath's healing shrine - Aquae Sulis, established by the Romans - suggests that Leucetius may have been a god of healing. In Gaul, Leucetius was believed to be an incarnation of Mars, presumably as a healing deity, as the warrior Mars was sometimes depicted fighting off disease. The name Leucetius includes the syllable indicative of "bright" or "shining", signifying "lightning."
