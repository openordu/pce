Laoghaire mac Crimthann, the partner of the sun goddess or heroine Dér Gréine, secured her love by vanquishing the formidable Giant, Goll Mac Morna. A young Fairy king named Fiachna enticed Laoghaire to the Otherworld, beseeching him to assist in defeating an invader. Eager to help, Laoghaire became ensnared; having entered FairyLAND, he discovered that he could never return home, and there he stayed for eternity.
