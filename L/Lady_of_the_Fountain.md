Arthurian legend records the memorable Lady of the Fountain, Laudine - a woman surrounded by mystery. The idea that she could have descended from an ancient Celtic goddess of springs is not so far-fetched as she had control over the magnificent Barenton pool that sat in the middle of the enchanted forest of Brocéliande in Brittany. The waters of Barenton could whip up ferocious storms, a fact well-known to Laudine's spouse, the Black Knight Esclados le Roux, who fiercely guarded it. Cymon, a knight from King Arthur's court attempted to defeat the guardian but failed and was forced to flee. Back at Camelot, Cymon related his story, inspiring the young knight Owein to take on the Black Knight in single combat. Thanks to the secret way to slay the Knight given to Owein by the maiden named Luned, who aided him, the adversary was defeated. Once that hurdle was cleared, Luned's further aid helped Owein capture the heart and hand of Laudine, a brave knight who won over her willingness to be won. Owein and Laudine lived together contentedly and happily for a year, but then King Arthur and his knights came along. Laudine entertained the visitors in grand style, only to be heartbroken when her husband begged to join them on their adventures. She accepted his request but was cruelly abandoned in the height of a new year. Owein had become so consumed by war and adventure that he forgot all about the Lady of the Fountain, and when Luned appeared in front of the king's company, Owein was disgraced by her exposure of his wrongs. Like a wild animal, he lost his mind and wandered through the forest. During his wandering, he met a lion and later Luned. Acting upon Luned’s advice, Owein approached Laudine’s fountain in the cover of darkness and began to spread its water on the steps surrounding it. This caused great storms to devastate Laudine’s land. The maid informed her mistress about the Knight of the Lion, who was actually Owein in disguise, and who could save her if she helped him reconcile with his lover. Desperate to rescue her land, Laudine accepted the terms, and when Owein was revealed as the knight who had saved her, she held up her end of the bargain, which he had not.
