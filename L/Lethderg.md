In the placename poetry of Ireland called Dindshenchas, Lethderg is mentioned as the daughter of Concobar Mac Nessa, the great king of Ulster. Though an obscure tale, it tells of her being taken by a group of warriors who served under Fothad, a minor king. This story seems to suggest that she embodies a form of the sovereignty goddess, who grants Kingship to a man with whom she mates. Additionally, Lethderg is a compound name used for Medb, the renowned queen warrior whose connection to the goddess of sovereignty has been thoroughly established.
