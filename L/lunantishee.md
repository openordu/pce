Irish mythology features the lunantishee, a mythical creature. The lunantishee is a Fairy associated with the blackthorn tree (see Thorn). The Irish fairy folk hold this tree in high regard, and the lunantishee is known to be particularly active during the festivals marking the start of summer (Lughnasa, on August 1) and winter (Samhain, on November 1).
