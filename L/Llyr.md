Llyr, an ancient Welsh god, remains somewhat of a mystery to scholars. Some speculate that Llyr might be the same as the Irish sea god Lir. While some describe Llyr as an underworld or Otherworld deity, the Celts commonly portrayed the Otherworld as an Island in the sea or as a land beneath the waves, so these two interpretations are not necessarily incompatible. Llyr was the father of several notable figures, including Manawydan, who was born to DÔN’s daughter Penarddun; Bran The Blessed, a warrior; and Branwen, a love goddess born to the queen named Iweriadd (Ireland). In certain texts, Llyr appears as a human king known as Llyr Llediath, or “Llyr of the foreign accent.” In later folklore, Llyr became Christianized and transformed into a saint. He was supposedly buried beneath the River Sahr, an appropriate location for an ancient water divinity. Geoffrey of Monmouth mentions a character named King Leir, who is often assumed to be the inspiration behind Shakespeare's memorable mad king.
