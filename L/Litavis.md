A Celtic goddess by the name of Litavis (Litavus) remains somewhat of a mystery. Her name appears to be tied to words meaning “earth” or “broad,” hinting at her potential role as a divine presence of the world as a whole. According to some accounts, she was the partner of the deity Cicollus, whom the Romans equated with their god Mars, but it appears that unlike Cicollus, Litavis was not given a new name by the invading Roman legions.
