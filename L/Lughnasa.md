A significant Celtic festival, Lughnasa (also known as Lammas, Lughnasadh, Lughnasad, Garland Sunday, Crom Dudb Sunday, Bilberry Sunday and Calan Awst on the Isle of Man and in Wales), marked the end of the four major Celtic feasts and took place on August 1st to celebrate the harvest. It was named after the deity Lugh, who was also known for the great Council of the Gauls among the continental Celts. The Roman emperor Augustus demanded that the council took place at the altar devoted to Lugh in Lyons in 12 B.C.E, in order to assert his authority over the subdued Celts and suggest that he could be a substitute during Celtic worship. In Ireland, it was believed that Lugh created the festival in memory of his mother, the goddess Tailtiu, who passed away on the same day. To honor her, an athletic event was hosted in her name. Lugh’s mother was alternatively referred to as Balor’s daughter Eithne, with Tailtiu acting as Lugh’s foster mother. Nonetheless, other accounts suggest that the event was commemorated in respect for Lugh’s two wives, Buí (a Cow goddess) and Nás (otherwise associated with the term “assembly”), when combined describing a Cattle fair. Lughnasa was mainly intended to denote the harvest festival, but it was also a ceremony to soothe any potential threats to the harvest. It was celebrated with fairs and gatherings, some of which are still held today. August 1 was the date of the Celtic festival, Lughnasa. However, the shift from Julian to Gregorian calendars during the Middle Ages had a more significant impact on Lughnasa than the other festivities. Today, remnants of Lughnasa celebrations can be found in regions that were formerly Celtic, spanning from late July until mid-August. Although there is debate amongst scholars regarding which festivals are related to Lughnasa, they all share a common theme of celebrating first fruits and livestock sales. In England, Lughnasa festivals are held at Britford Fair in Warminster on August 11 and at Highworth Fair on August 13, which are both sheep fairs. Lughnasa fairs were occasions when contracts were established, possibly reflecting Lugh's ancient role as an executor and guarantor of oaths. One contract was the engagement or marriage pact, including the Teltown marriage, a trial marriage where the couple pledged themselves until the next Lughnasa, where the bond could be made permanent or dissolved without consequences. On the Isle of Man, the grand Santon fair took place, where people came together to exchange produce and livestock on August 1. Visiting holy wells was frequent, and climbing mountains was a popular activity. Snaefell Mountain was the preferred destination, and rumors circulated about inappropriate actions that took place among young people enjoying the Lughnasa holiday. In Wales, Lughnasa is known as Calan Awst or the August Festival and is traditionally celebrated by climbing hills to collect berries. According to Welsh tradition, Lughnasa was the day that the biblical figure Jephthah's unnamed daughter went to the mountains to cry over the fact that she would be killed before losing her virginity. This narrative, similar to the Manx tales of sexual misconduct, implies that enjoying sexuality in the outdoors was a part of the festival. In Ireland, the Sunday closest to the date of Lughnasa is traditionally celebrated as the harvest festival. The festival goes by various names, such as Garland Sunday, Bilberry Sunday, and Crom Derg Sunday (named after an early harvest god). In Co. Mayo, it is called Reek Sunday after the mountain, Croagh Patrick, where the largest Lughnasa celebration is held today. As many as 60,000 pilgrims climb the pyramidal peak by the sea nearest Lughnasa Sunday. According to local tradition, pilgrims who climb the mountain three times are guaranteed a place in heaven. Nowadays, Christian pilgrims reaching the summit find a chapel dedicated to St. Patrick, who is said to have battled the forces of evil at that location. The ruins of neolithic structures also suggest that the site was sacred to pre-Celtic people, while the name Lughnasa for the climb indicates that the Celts have retained the mountain's sanctity. There are over a dozen Lughnasa mountains in Ireland, with Mount Brandon in Kerry hosting another important ascent still held on Lughnasa. Near Brandon, the oldest known Lughnasa celebration takes place in the small town of Kilorglin during Puck Fair. Puck Fair is now a street fair which includes booths and bands, but it is believed by some to be an ancient festival with Celtic origins, despite researchers claiming it dates back only a few hundred years. During Puck Fair, which lasts three days (Gathering Day, Fair Day, and Scattering Day), a wild goat from a nearby mountainside is caught and brought to town where it is displayed on a high platform above the main street. Associations between the Lughnasa festival and licentious behavior may be reflected in the goat's reputation as a randy creature. In Scotland, Lughnasa celebrations generally occur around St. Michael's Day or Michaelmas on September 29th. After Christianization, the archangel Michael replaced Lugh. Michael, a popular figure in the Highlands, was the patron saint of horses, a seemingly odd role for an angel, but celebrated with races nonetheless. The eve of Michael's feast was marked by the baking of carrots in a special bread pudding known as a struan, and a cereal made from all the locally grown grains. Carrots, the most phallic of vegetables, were also exchanged as tokens of affection, leading to Michaelmas sometimes being referred to as Carrot Sunday. Circuits of burial grounds and visitations to cemeteries indicated a darker aspect to the festival.
