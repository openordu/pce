Irish divinity Luchtar, also known as Luchta, was a god of minor stature in the realm of craftsmanship. He was the smith Goibniu's sibling and held dominion over carpentry. Luchtar played a crucial role in the mythic second battle of Mag Tuired by fashioning spearshafts for the Tuatha Dé Dananns, the warrior-gods of the goddess Danu, in their battle against the monstrous Fomorians.
