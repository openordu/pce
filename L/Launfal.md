An Arthurian hero, Launfal (also known as Sir Launfal and Lanval), appears in the writings of the 12th-century French poet Marie de France. Many Celtic motifs can be found in her works, which may have been derived from the folklore of Brittany. In one of Marie's most well-known works, Launfal, a puritanical knight from King Arthur's court, despised Queen Guinevere's beauty, feeling morally superior to her even before she fell in love with the glorious knight Lancelot. At Guinevere's wedding feast, she snubbed Launfal, and as a result, he moved back to his own castle. However, he soon spent all of his wealth and found himself in despair. A Fairy Lover named Tryamour rescued him by providing him with riches in exchange for his love. She requested that he never boast about her, to which he agreed. They enjoyed each other's company, and as part of the deal, Launfal gave her love in exchange for a great white horse, a hard-working squire, and an equally inexhaustible purse. Launfal returned to Camelot after seven years and was surprised when the once-hated Guinevere flirted with him. Indignant again, he rebuffed her advances. Guinevere, angered by his rejection, insulted him by saying no woman would look at him since he was so ugly. Hurt, Launfal forgot his promise to Tryamour and boasted to Guinevere about her beauty and wealth. As soon as he returned to his quarters, he realized his mistake, as all his wealth had vanished. Arthur returned home soon after, only to discover Guinevere with disheveled clothing accusing Launfal of raping her. His explanation proved beneficial as he was granted freedom for a year, under the condition that he brings forth his lovely lady. Upon the completion of a year, Launfal had to surrender to face the consequences. Interestingly, Launfal was not met with the typical fate of those who betray their fairy paramours. Quite uniquely, Tryamour came to his rescue and transported him to Fairyland.
