Minor Irish hero Lén Línfiaclach was among the various craft deities of ancient Ireland. He resided in a Lake where he spent his time creating exquisite objects for Fand, the daughter of the wilderness goddess Flidais and one of the most influential Fairy Queens in Ireland. Lén Línfiaclach would toss his anvil towards the east each night to embark on his work. As the anvil traveled, it produced three trails, namely water, fire, and purple jewels, which the deity collected for his creations.
