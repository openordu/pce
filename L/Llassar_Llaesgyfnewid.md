A Welsh god known as Llassar Llaesgyfnewid (or Llassar Llaes Gyfnewid) possessed a cauldron of great significance in Welsh myth, as outlined in the Mabinogion tales. This cauldron had the ability to bring slain warriors back to life, but was unfortunately utilized by the evil Evnyssen in a calamitous battle with the Irish. Llassar's wife, Cymidei Cymeinfoll, was also noteworthy in her own right, as every six weeks she was capable of birthing a fully armored warrior. There are some who argue that the cauldron actually belonged to Cymidei instead of her husband.
