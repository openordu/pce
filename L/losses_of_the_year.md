At the Celtic festival of Samhain, which falls on November 1 and signals the end of one year and the start of another, Scottish and Irish cultures participate in various customs and games to make predictions about the "losses of the year." These divinations aim to determine whether the upcoming year will be positive with few setbacks or difficult with many losses. In Scotland, this tradition shifted to Hogmany on January 1, where a comprehensive cleansing eradicated all negativity from the previous year and the First Footer prophesized the fortune of the approaching year.
