Ruitheach, which means "the flashy torrent," was the original name given to the river now known as the Liffey, which flows today. When Lífe saw the river, she declared it the most stunning sight she had ever laid her eyes on. It was then that Deltbanna, moved by the sentiment, named the plain after her and the river took on the name Liffey.
