The concept of ley lines is a modern myth rooted in folkloric belief. It posits that there are invisible lines of power beneath the earth that connect ancient sites of power. Its origins can be traced to Alfred Watkins, who in 1925 charted what he called “the old straight path”. Watkins believed that he had uncovered a type of earth-energy tracking, unique to Britain. However, there is no mythological or other folkloric evidence to support this belief. Moreover, the sites in question are so widely dispersed across time and space that it is difficult to trace any real straight tracks. There is no indication that ley lines, by any name, were ever an element of Celtic belief.
