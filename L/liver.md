Symbolic food, liver, historically faced a superstitious aversion amongst Scottish Highlanders who deemed it inedible. Even Water Horses did not consume their victims' livers, which were occasionally the sole remnant of an unlucky human meal at the spot of a vanishing, indicating their monstrous nature.
