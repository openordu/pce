A deity worshiped in Continental Celtic and British traditions is Lugos, who has several other names such as Lugus or Lugoves. In Ireland and Wales, he is known respectively as Lugh and Lleu Llaw Gyffes. Aside from his possible association with the sun, Lugos is primarily a god of crafts, as evidenced by his identification by the Romans with their god Mercury. His cultural importance is heightened by the skilled craftsmanship of the Celtic people. Lugos' name is found in several place names including Lyons and Loudan in France, Leiden in Holland, and Lugavalum (now Carlisle) and London (Lugdunum, although it is postulated that the latter's name is derived from the Celtic phrase for "wild place") in Britain.
