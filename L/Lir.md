Lir, a notable Irish hero, has been associated with the Irish sea god, Manann√°n, who was known as "mac Lir" or "son of Lir." Nevertheless, there is uncertainty surrounding who Lir truly was. Some have suggested that he was a former sea deity who was integrated into the mythology of an invading people by being considered as the precursor or father of one of their gods. Lir should not be confused with Shakespeare's King Lear, who may have been influenced by the Welsh deity Lludd. Shakespeare might have also been mixing him up with Llyr, another Welsh god. Lir could either be identical to or separate from the king who was the father of the children transformed into swans - the Children of Lir - by their malevolent stepmother. This particular story, which is among the most familiar in Irish legend today, is not ancient but rather came from France or Britain during the Middle Ages. Incidentally, the story features numerous Celtic motifs and themes, including magical incantations and shapeshifting.
