An Irish heroine by the name of Leborcham, also known as Lavercam, Lebarcham, Levarcham, and Lebharcham, was the nurse for Deirdre of the Sorrows, a tragic heroine. Leborcham was born a slave but had become a member of the nobility due to her intelligence and physical prowess, ultimately becoming a Bard. She possessed the remarkable ability to run the entirety of Ireland and back within a single day, which caught the attention of Ulster’s king, Concobar Mac Nessa. When Deirdre was born, Concobar intended to raise her as his concubine despite predictions that she would bring about the downfall of the land. Leborcham was entrusted with the responsibility of raising and educating Deirdre. Upon seeing a Raven’s blood on the snow, Deirdre became enchanted by a man whose features were similar to the sight: Noísiu, Deirdre's fated lover, which Leborcham revealed to her. Even after Deirdre and her lover were tricked into returning from their Scottish exile, Leborcham remained devoted to her charge and attempted to convince the girl to leave Ireland. Deirdre refused, however, and Leborcham then sought to deceive Concobar by telling him that Deirdre's beauty had been destroyed by the hardship of living in the wilderness. Unfortunately, Concobar saw through the ruse and when Deirdre's lover was killed, she chose death over being Concobar's enslaved consort.
