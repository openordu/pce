Archaeologists discovered a crucial and perplexing Celtic artifact in 1984 called the Lindow Man. Located in a bog close to the town of Lindow in Britain, it was the well-preserved body of a human believed to be a victim of the Threefold Death of Irish mythology. The bog's tannic water contributed to its conservation. It cannot be determined if this man had violated a law of his time or was offered to alleviate famine or plague, but the discovery provoked extensive inquiry.
