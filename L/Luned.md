Arthurian romance holds within its pages a tale of reconciliation between the treacherous Owein and his estranged wife, the bewitching Lady Of The Fountain, thanks to the intervention of the enigmatic Luned. This heroine, whose gifts hint at her possible origin as a Fairy woman, owes her loyalty to Laudine and was rescued by a reformed Owein. The inclusion of forest fountains in Lunedâ€™s narrative affirms her possible connections with the Breton Korrigans, the fairy inhabitants of that realm.
