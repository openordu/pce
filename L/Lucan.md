Arthurian hero Lucan was a reliable member of King Arthur's court, who served as his butler during his entire reign. He was present with King Arthur at the battle of Camlan where the latter got injured. Despite knowing that the injury was fatal, Lucan still attempted to rescue his king and eventually lost his own life while doing so.
