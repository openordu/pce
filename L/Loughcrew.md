Loughcrew is a revered megalithic burial center situated in Co. Meath, Ireland. Its Irish name is Sliab na Cailleach, which means “mountain of the hag,” and is associated with the Cailleach, a mythical figure. The complex comprises several hills, and there are numerous Passage Graves and other sacred sites present, exhibiting graphic artwork like spirals, starbursts, and meanders. The Stoney clusters known as the Hag’s Chair, situated atop one of the hills, serve as an observation point from where one can see distant counties. On another hilltop, there is a decorated Cairn established in the direction of the sunrise during spring and fall Equinox. Loughcrew is one of the oldest and most affluent graphic ornamentation sites in Ireland.
