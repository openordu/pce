British folklore is rich with spirits and entities, one of which is known as lob. The syllable lob can be found in numerous Fairy names throughout Britain. Lob-Lie-by-the-Fire was a significant Brownie who, despite his idling name, performed strenuous farm work. The term lubber, which means a clumsy and foolish person, originates from this word and was once used to describe individuals who were too preoccupied with everyday life.
