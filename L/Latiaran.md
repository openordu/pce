In the northern Co. Cork town of Cullen, a monument is dedicated to the late Irish goddess or heroine known as Latiaran (Lateerin, Lateeran). The monument takes the form of a Standing Stone, roughly shaped like a heart, which stands close to a small holy Well that now honors St. Latiaran, a woman of holiness unknown elsewhere. According to local legend, Latiaran was so modest that she is said to have dropped her apron when a smith complimented the shapeliness of her ankles while she carried some boulders or hot coals. Upon dropping her apron, Latiaran is said to have disappeared beneath a standing stone that had fallen out of the apron and had wedged itself upright in the ground. This stone, referred to as Latiaran’s heart, can still be seen in a patch of grass near the graveyard in Cullen. Two elements of the story suggest that an ancient goddess might have been converted into a saint upon the coming of Christianity. The smith, known elsewhere as a magical being whose prototype is the god Goibniu, and the motif of rocks falling from the apron is characteristic of tales that feature the world-creating Hag, the Cailleach. The barren names of Latiaran's two sisters (Lasair meaning flame and Inghean Bhuidhe that refer to a yellow-haired girl) suggest that she might have been a fire goddess. Or alternatively, she might have been one of the seasonal divinities, with each of her three sisters ruling a different part of the growing season: Lasair — the first of spring, Inghean Bhuidhe — the beginning of summer, and Latiaran enjoying the harvesttime. The significance of the latter connection is underscored by the local tradition that women should show deference to Latiarin’s heart by curtsying to it during the harvest and by the marking of Latiarin’s feast day on the last Sunday in July, which is the old Celtic festival of Lughnasa. The celebration of the harvest known as Latiaran is still observed by rural people in the region, and features the use of a Pattern or ritual. Latiaran Sunday, occurring on or just prior to July 25, marking the feast day of Latiaran, was historically the first day for eating potatoes in the area, with fair weather being the norm. While Latiaran’s name is found only in Cullen, it has been considered as a diminutive variant (spurring from a hypothetical Laisrian) of the renowned figure Lasair. The latter may have been a variation or derivative of Brigit, much like Latiaran. It is said that both Lasair and Latiaran have carried hot coals, and Brigit was connected with fire, which may indicate that Lasair and Latiaran were early names or titles for her.
