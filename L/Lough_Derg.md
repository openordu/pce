Lough Derg, located in Co. Donegal, is a site steeped in Irish mythology. According to legend, a monstrous creature named Caoranach once occupied the lake and was killed by St. Patrick, whose victory stained the waters a dark red hue, giving the lake its name. Co. Galway also boasts a Lake of the same name, where Bodb Derg, the great magician of the Tuatha Dé Danann, was believed to have had his palace. Since the advent of Christianity in Ireland, Lough Derg in Donegal has been regarded as the most significant place of pilgrimage, largely due to the presence of St. Patrick’s Station Island, where the saint purportedly descended through a cave to do battle with evil in an Otherworld. It is worth noting that this tale is not from early Christian times, but from the medieval period. In the late 16th century, pilgrims were accommodated in dormitories based on their Province, giving the island the character of a microcosm of Ireland. People still flock to this site in pilgrimage to this day.
