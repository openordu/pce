Five brothers went hunting and crossed paths with a Hag. The Hag was guarding a Well and insisted that one of them spend the night with her. All the brothers, named Lugaidh except for Lugaidh Laíghde, were repulsed, but Lugaidh Laíghde accepted the proposition and slept with her. The Hag, delighted with his potency, transformed into a beautiful and youthful maiden. She disclosed herself to him as the goddess of Sovereignty.
