An Irish heroine known as Lí Ban (also known as Liban) featured in The Annals of Ireland during the 17th century, although her story supposedly dates back to the 6th century. She was commonly referred to as “finest of women” or “beauty of womanhood.” She was considered the daughter of Aéd Abrat, the king of Tara, or the unknown Ecca (whose mother was Étain), with no mention of Lí Ban’s mother. Unfortunately, a sacred well was left uncovered by someone, leading to a flood that carried Lí Ban away. The well overflowed and destroyed the entire kingdom of Aéd Abrat, drowning him and most of his family, leaving Lí Ban and her lapdog as the only survivors, living in a bubble underwater for a year. During her time, she observed the playful salmon as they reside comfortably in the water realm, and she soon prayed to become like them. Her wish was granted, and she transformed into a mermaid with a woman’s torso and head and a salmon’s tail. Her dog transformed into an otter, and together, they swam in the waters of Lough Neagh for 300 years, while Ireland became a Christian nation. This theme of transformation is evident in the tales of other maidens, including Fionnuala, and Oisín's story, who resided in Fairyland with Niamh of the Golden Hair. Eventually, after three centuries, Lí Ban called out to a passing boat crew, pleading with them to capture her and meet her ashore at Inver Ollarbha. In a boat, there was a priest named Beoc who had gone to Rome on an errand and arranged for the capture of a mermaid. The mermaid was pulled up and placed in a half-submerged boat so that she could swim until they had determined what to do with her. Initially, local kings and priests argued over who had the authority to claim her. However, angels instructed them to wait for two oxen or stags to appear, and then to trust that the beasts would carry the maiden to the territory in which she belonged. The miraculous oxen did appear and carried Lí Ban to the church of Priest Beoc. There, she requested baptism so that she could die immediately and ascend to heaven. Her wish was granted, and she was named Murgen, meaning “sea-born.” She immediately died and became a Saint, a holy virgin. The blending of pagan and Christian elements reveals how primitive deities were brought into the realm of the new religion. Lí Ban was presumably a goddess once, like Bóand and Sínann, whose myths involve wells that magically overflow. However, under the accumulation of Christian motifs, her original myth is likely irrevocably lost. Another Lí Ban was a Fairy Queen, the ruler of the land of Mag Mell, the honeyed plain, and the sister of the stunning fairy Fand. Alongside her husband, they asked the hero Cúchulainn to rescue them from monstrous Fomorians, initiating one of Ireland's greatest love stories. Without introducing the subject, I will state that there was a man who fell in love with Fand despite being married to Emer, who was considered a perfect woman. This love affair was the only one that endangered their otherwise strong marriage. See <TOPIC>.
