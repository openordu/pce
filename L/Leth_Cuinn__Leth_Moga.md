Irish land was divided between Leth Cuinn and Leth Moga, which were named after the two leaders Conn of the Hundred Battles and Eógan Mór respectively, along the Eiscir Riada. This great glacial ridge separated Ireland from Dublin to Galway. Leth Cuinn was situated in the north, while Leth Moga in the south. These regional designations were just some of the many historic divisions of Ireland, the most prevalent being the partition into the five Provinces.
