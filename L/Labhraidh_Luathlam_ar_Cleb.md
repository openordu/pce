Labhraidh Luathlam, also known as Labriad, is an Irish hero or god who ruled over the magical plain of honey called Mag Mell. Trees in this realm always bore magical fruit while vats of mead remained impossible to empty. Labhraidh was the one who facilitated the meeting of Cúchulainn, a renowned hero, with his wife's sister, the beautiful Fairy Queen Fand. In exchange, Cúchulainn was required to defeat three warriors who were causing trouble for Labhraidh. This agreement ultimately led to a love triangle, with Fand being the only one who could entice Cúchulainn to be unfaithful to his wife Emer, a woman of unmatched beauty. The tale of Labhraidh, Cúchulainn, Fand, and Emer is recounted in an ancient text called Cúchulainn's Sickness, which was the basis for William Butler Yeats' play, The Only Jealousy of Emer.
