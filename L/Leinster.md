Irish province Leinster, one of the five divisions of Ireland along with Ulster, Munster, Connacht and Mide, is situated in the east - where the modern capital of Dublin resides. Its traditional associations include wealth, trade, nobility, refinement and hearty hospitality. Leinster has historically been the wealthiest out of Ireland's provinces, forming the "pale" Anglo influence during the English occupation, which in turn created the expression "beyond the pale" that pointed to areas that remained primarily Celtic. Its name comes from a prehistoric Celtic group named after the Lagin (Laigin, Laighnigh). Nowadays, Leinster comprises of counties Dublin, Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Westmeath, Wexford, and Wicklow.
