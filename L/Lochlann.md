Mythological Irish tales mention the site of Lochlann as the northern land of the Fomorians, who were adversaries of the magical Tuatha Dé Danann and other mythological Irish races. The Fomorians are sometimes referred to as Lochlanns or Lochlannachs. Scholars have suggested that Lochlann could be Denmark and lower Scandinavia. Among the Fomorians, Berva was known as their capital city; however, it remains a mystery as it has never been found and is believed to be entirely legendary.
