A mythological location in Ireland is Lough Ree. This lake is created by the River Shannon and there is a tale that a city can be seen in its clear depths. On the shores of this lake, queen and goddess Medb suffered her demise at the hands of her nephew Furbaide Ferbend. This act of vengeance was provoked by Medb's murder of her own sister Clothra.
