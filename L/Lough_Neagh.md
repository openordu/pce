A mythical site in Ireland is Lough Neagh, a large lake in the northern Ulster province, which was essentially a well. After the lid was left off carelessly, the waters exploded and the lake took shape. During this transformation, Lí Ban's family drowned, and the girl was left alone with her pet dog beneath the waves. Lí Ban prayed to be turned into a fish after observing the sea creatures around her; she was turned into a Mermaid with a Salmon's tail instantly, and her little dog turned into an Otter. According to other tales from the region, a magical city emerges beneath the lake's waters during clear days. Additionally, legends claim that the folkloric Finn Mccool created the lake by scooping up some soil and hurling it at a running Giant, with the lake being the concave area created by Finn's hand and the Isle of Man being the clod of soil he threw.
