Labhraigh, a hero of Irish mythology, is believed to be both a mythical and historical figure who is considered an ancestor of the people of Leinster. According to legend, he conquered his territory by defeating his opponent, Cobhthach, in the second century B.C.E. In a more extended version of the story, there were two kings named Labhraigh, one of whom was Labhraigh Lorc. His brother, Cobhthach, was an evil and power-hungry individual who aspired to become the king of Leinster by eliminating Ailill Áine, the rightful king. Cobhthach pretended to be on his deathbed and took advantage of Labhraigh's grief to kill him, following which Cobhthach poisoned Ailill. The true king's son, Moen, was speechless until one day, while playing football, he was struck by a ball and regained his voice. His playmates thus called him Labhraigh Moen, which meant "the speechless one speaks." Labhraigh Moen was known to be a kind and generous nobleman who was exiled to Munster, where he met Moriath, the king's daughter. He seduced her with the help of Craiphtine, his harper, and escaped with her. Although Moriath's mother knew what had happened, it did not deter the lovers, and her parents did not attempt to prevent their union. The king welcomed Labhraigh and they traveled east to reclaim his kingdom. Using Craiphtine's magical music once again, they first captured the fort at Dinn Ríg by putting the defenders to sleep while the attackers covered their ears. Labhraigh Moen then constructed an Iron hall and trapped the usurper Cobhthach and his army inside while heating it up with bellows until they all perished. However, an alternate version of the story suggests that Cobhthach made Moen eat the hearts of his father and grandfather which left him speechless. Moen was banished to Brittany where he heard the music of Craiphtine and was deeply moved. He broke his silence to sing praises of the harper and raised an army to defeat Cobhthach at Dinn Ríg. Scholars have attempted to decipher the truth behind these exaggerated accounts. Some suggest that Moen's speechlessness was due to his unfamiliarity with the language of the country or because he was blemished in some way. Another version tells of Moen having the ears of an ass and anyone who spoke of it would be killed. A barber whispered the secret to a tree, which was then carved into a harp for Craiphtine, and it sang out the secret entrusted to it. Uncomfortable with his appearance, Labhraigh exposed his unattractive ears to everyone, feeling ashamed.
