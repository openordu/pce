A British folkloric figure, the Lubbard Fiend is mentioned by the great English poet John Milton in his work L’Allegro. Milton describes a "drudging Goblin" who threshed corn tirelessly, exceeding the work that 10 laborers could manage, before sleeping by the fire until dawn, from where he then disappeared. Milton's negative description of the helpful Fairy farmhand could be attributed to the Puritan language of the time. While not found in other sources, the character could be perceived as a friendly Brownie or potentially a lubber (see Lob).
