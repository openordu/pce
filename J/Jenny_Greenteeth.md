British folklore tells of Jenny Greenteeth, a menacing sprite or boggart that was known to haunt the streams of Lancashire until the 19th century. She was believed to have the intention of drowning anyone that passed her by. Scholars suggest that spirits of this sort may originate from early water deities, hinting at a distant folk memory of human sacrifice. Although some scholars regard Jenny as mere fiction, a bedtime story meant to discourage mischievous children, teaching them to avoid running near water bodies where danger might lurk because the existence of a green-toothed monster hiding in pools would deter them.
