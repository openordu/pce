French heroine Joan d’Arc (Jeanne-d’Arc) was born ca. 1412 C.E. in the northern region of Lorraine, where ancient beliefs remained a part of superstitions despite the prevalence of Christianity. Since her early life, Joan began to hear voices she understood to be Saints revealing her destiny. Clad in male attire, she traveled at the age of about 15, to meet the Dauphin, the embattled heir to the French throne, and announced herself as his general. The Dauphin and his advisers were aware of the propaganda value of her quest, and her oddly charismatic nature surprised them with her quick and accurate grasp of military strategy. At the front of her army, Joan liberated Orléans by driving through the English ranks and consequently acquired the title "Maid of Orléans." Within a year, she had won the throne for the Dauphin, crowned as Charles VII with Joan by his side. However, despite her prowess, Joan was imprisoned by French allies of the British, who then handed her over to the enemy, after which a trial was conducted over charges of Witchcraft. During the trial, Joan refused to deny her "voices," the sources of her inspiration, leading to her being burnt at the stake in 1431 when she was not even 20. After 25 years, she was granted a posthumous "trial" wherein she was declared innocent, and in 1920, the Roman Catholic Church canonized her. Both fictional and non-fictional attempts have been made to link Joan d’Arc to residual Celtic theories in the French countryside where she was raised. Hailing from a region in France with a historical connection to the Celts, Joan's inner strength was amplified by supernatural forces that were beyond the tangible. She became a representation of the Celtic portrayal of women as warriors, an ancient ideal that had been concealed for ages. Contemporary writers, especially Anne Chamberlin (The Merlin of St. Giles Well, The Merlin of the Oak Wood), use the Celtic themes found in Joan's historical account as a source for inspiration. The fact that Joan's inquisitors questioned her about her knowledge of the Fairy faith and its practitioners implies that this perspective is founded on longstanding tradition. Despite this, Joan was unequivocal about her devotion to Christianity, and stated that her inspiration came solely from the voices of saints, rather than those of fairies.
