A masked young man dressed in a costume of leaves would dance through the streets in some rural British communities where spring festivals descended from the Celtic spring feast of Beltane continued until recently. This figure is known as Jack-in-the-Green, and he is believed to have connections with Celtic tree-cults or with the enigmatic character, the Green Man, that can be found in certain architectural contexts in Britain.
