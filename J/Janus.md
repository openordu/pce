Janus was the name of the Roman god who had two faces that gazed in different directions. The month of January, which looks towards both the new and old year, is derived from the name of this deity. In Celtic regions, the Romans found a number of statues depicting two faces, belonging to gods whose names are now unknown. These statues were referred to as Janiform, since they resembled the god Janus. The original significance of these Celtic statues has been lost over time, but some scholars have linked them to the respect for the Head as a symbol of essence and power, as well as the belief in special abilities bestowed upon twins.
