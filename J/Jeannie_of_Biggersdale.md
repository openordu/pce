The British spirit called Jeannie of Biggersdale was believed to exist in Musgrave Woods located in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Much like the other Bogies or boggarts, Jeannie frightened travelers who passed through her domain. It is said that a farmer once tried to banish her from the area but his attempt ended in tragedy. Jeannie cut his horse in half, and the farmer barely managed to survive. See topic "Jeannie of Biggersdale" on page 6J 266 for more information.
