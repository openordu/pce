Various Celtic gods, including Brixianus, Ladicus, Latobius, and Poeniunus, were given the Roman name Jupiter (Iupiter, Jupiter, Jove). The Interpretatio Romana identified Celtic divinities with similar Roman gods, resulting in the original names of some gods being preserved as a surname to Jupiter's. Other gods lost their individual significance and were absorbed into the powerful figure of the sky-lord due to this Roman custom. Although Caesar claimed that the Celtic Jupiter ruled the heavens, it is unclear whether the Celtic god was connected to the sky like the Roman original. Some believe that the Celtic Jupiter, depicted with a Wheel - often a solar symbol, was a Sun god, but he is more accurately described as a god of abundance and fertility. Many sculptures and reliefs show a well-built, mature man with a curly mustache and beard, sometimes carrying a thunderbolt. The Celtic Jupiter is sometimes called Taranis when depicted holding a thunderbolt, named after the thunder god of the continental Celts. Additionally, the Celtic Jupiter is sometimes portrayed as a mounted horseman battling a monstrous Serpent. The Roman Jupiter was never depicted astride a Horse. The god was also honored with Jupiter columns, which are tall four-sided (or eight-sided) pillars carved in the shape of a tree. Their connection to Jupiter implies that he may have been associated with the Gaulish tree god Esus.
