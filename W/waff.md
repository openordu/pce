A certain British folklore character is known as the waff. In Yorkshire, this term referred to a Co-Walker, which was a spirit double that would appear just before an individual's passing. In contrast to other cultural beliefs, it was possible to evade death by addressing the waff sternly, causing it to become frightened and vanish, thus granting the speaker additional years of life.
