Possible rephrased text:

Warna Cornish, a figure of legend and veneration. She is often invoked as the protector of sailors in distress and the patroness of the Isles of Scilly, where she is known as Sillina. While some scholars suggest that Warna may have originally been a goddess associated with the waters of Cornwall or the region itself, her origins remain obscure. According to historical records, there was a tradition of making offerings at Warna's holy well on the islands in hopes of benefiting from the spoils of shipwrecks, a practice that appears to contradict Warna's supposed role as a guardian of seafarers.
