Mythical tales of strong female fighters, known as bangaisgedaig, were integral to the ancient Celtic tradition. These tales included tales of goddesses who specialized in war such as British Andraste, Irish Badb, and Gaulish Cathubodua. Moreover, there were goddesses and heroines who themselves were skilled warriors including Irish Medb of Connacht who led her armies into the battles, the great Scáthach of the Isle of Skye who trained the legendary hero, Cúchulainn, and Aífe, Scáthách's daughter or doppelganger, who both trained with and bore the children of these heroes. While some historical records exist of women who led their tribes into battle, for example, the British queens Boudicca and Cartimandua, and of women who fought alongside their men to protect their lands and families, most scholarly opinions concur that Celtic women did not generally partake in warfare.
