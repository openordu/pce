A site of mythological significance, the holy wells still remain active in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. A recorded 3,000 wells exist in Ireland alone. Although they are typically named after saints, there is concrete evidence of their original pagan roots, dating back to pre-Celtic times but remaining revered during the Celtic era. As a necessity for health and life, water was highly cherished and considered a symbol of the magical Otherworld. Wells, usually located near bedrock where cool, clean water would sprout up more like a small stream than a deep pit, were deemed auspicious. The Inauguration of regional kings would take place at these sites, where they would drink from the water as a pledge of loyalty to the Sovereignty goddess. Today, these wells are still used for Healing rituals, the water believed to be especially potent on certain days, including the Celtic holidays such as Imbolc, Beltane, Lughnasa, and Samhain. With the advent of Christianity, these wells were consecrated as Christian sites, with a saint's name usually given to them, often resembling a Celtic divinity, for instance, Brigit. In this era, holy wells were also adorned with ribbons called Clooties which were fastened to nearby trees, and stones, coins, or other offerings were placed in or near the water. It was believed that the wells could move if they were upset by any kind of litter or garbage, and taboos were enforced stringently. There are many stories of wells leaving one district during the night, accompanied by Fairy Lights, and reappearing in a different region the next day. Myths that involve women guardians who protect wells are abundant and served to keep the water sources pure. In these fables, these female protectors can be either young and stunning, such as the Lady of the Fountain, or elderly and haggard, like Cailleach. Some of these tales warn women not to go near particular wells, especially if they house the Salmon of Wisdom. Despite these warnings, goddesses like Bóand and Sínann ventured to the well of Segais or CONNLAs well, only to be met with disaster as the well surged and chased them throughout the land, forming two rivers named after the goddesses themselves, the Boyne and the Shannon respectively. While typically interpreted as a cautionary message about women’s thirst for knowledge, the linkage between female guardians and wells hints that these tales were edited or are, in fact, origin stories, for by luring the water source out of its confines, Bóand and Sínann created the fertile watersheds of Ireland.

wheel
Symbolic object. As a Horse-rearing people who traveled in Chariots, the Celts learned how to made wheels early in their cultural history. Later the wheel became an image of divinities, especially those associated with the Sun, which was imagined wheeling through the sky;
- Rituals in honor of the sun often took the form of rolling wheels (sometimes set ablaze) down a hill. As a chariot wheel, the sun became connected with war, and it was often depicted with warrior gods.

White. Cosmological concept. Words translated as “white” are often found in names and titles of Celtic divinities. The word might be better translated as “shining” or “radiant,” for it refers to a quality of light rather than the absence of color. Many deities and heroic figures bear names that suggest they were seen as emanating brilliant light: Bóand (or Bó Find), the Irish Cow goddess, whose brightness may be the light reflecting off her River, the Boyne;
- Fintan the Salmon, who swam in the sacred Well and whose flesh carried all the world’s Wisdom.
- and the brilliant hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. "White Horse of Uffington." British mythological site. Near Oxford, at a high point of the Berkshire downs, a huge earth sculpture can be seen up to 20 miles away: the flowing, swirling lines of the White Horse of Uffington, created by digging shallowly in the ground. Because the earth is chalky at that spot, removing the grassy turf from the surface created a startling white line in the green grass. While there are several such British sculptures of great antiquity (see Cerne Abbas Giant), only one depicts the image of a Horse.
- "Other chalk-outlined white horses exist, but they are much later in date and unconnected to Britain’s prehistory and Celtic era. Almost 400 feet long, the White Horse looks down on a valley called the Vale of the White Horse, where ceremonial horse-racing may have occurred."
- a nearby small mound called Dragon Hill shows signs of wear on its top, as though spectators stood there watching events in the valley below. Folklore claims that the hill is flat because St. George buried a dragon there;
- David Miles, The Land of the White Horse: Visions of England (London: Frances Lincoln Limited, 2007), 31.
- one such coin shows a horse almost identical to the one carved into the hillside. Even presuming a Celtic origin, however, archaeologists are not settled on whether the figure represents a divinity and if so, which. Among the Celts, the horse was the emblem of the goddess Epona.
- There is no known horse god, nor is the White Horse anatomically a stallion. As the White Horse appears to be running from east to west, it may symbolize the Sun traveling across the sky from dawn to sunset. While the White Horse itself is an impressive earth sculpture it is even more impressive that it remains at all, for grass would soon obliterate the design were it not continually pulled out. Today the National Trust cares for the monument, but in the past it was “scoured” or cleared of encroaching grasses every seven years, when a huge local festival was held. For as much as 2,000 years, the people around Uffington kept the horse clearly outlined on its height, long after the reason for its creation and its meaning were lost.
