Following a religious funeral, it is customary for the Irish to come together and share food, drink, stories and music. This tradition has ancient roots, possibly stemming from pagan beliefs that the deceased journeyed to the Otherworld and could occasionally return, especially on Samhain night when the veil between worlds was thinnest. It is also possible that the wake originated from a belief that the recently departed were highly susceptible to Fairy Kidnapping, and the wake served as protection against such influences. On the other hand, the fear of the dead dragging the living into the Otherworld may have given rise to wake amusements as a protective measure. Traditionally, the non-Christian aspects of the wake held greater significance, to the extent that priests attempted to discourage traditional games that may have derived from ancient rituals. It was common for the wake to take place prior to, rather than after, the funeral service. The body was placed in the parlor or best room, with the face uncovered, allowing the deceased to "attend" the wake. The wake would be announced by loud keening or sobbing, often by women, as a means of expressing grief. While family members may keen, members of the community who were unrelated also assisted. During the wake, someone would always stay with the body, ensuring that the deceased was never alone while people were in the house. Visitors would arrive within the next 12 to 24 hours to pay their respects to the corpse, and eventually make their way to food and drink. No one was turned away from funerals in Ireland, regardless of their relationship with the deceased or the family. Despite the event's solemn nature, it was considered unlucky if visitors did not have a good time and laugh. The merriment often consisted of verbal jokes, stories, puns, and rhymes. Some of the games played during wakes, like "Making the Stack" and "I Have a Question," were purposely insulting while others, such as "lifting the corpse," wrestling, and piggyback riding, could cause commotion in the small space of an Irish cottage. Some of these games hinted at personal rebirth or focused on the cyclical nature of life in sexuality. Kissing games like Frumso Framso were also common, and many participated in ardent kissing at the wake.
