The wasteland is a motif in Celtic mythology that suggests if a king were to become physically or spiritually wounded, the land would become infertile, leading to famine among the people. The Blemished King is a central figure in many myths, although it remains uncertain how such beliefs were manifested in the lives of actual rulers. The Grail legend has inspired several significant literary works centered around the same motif, with the Fisher King being the most notable example. According to the legend, the king suffered a genital (or discreetly, a thigh) wound that rendered him incapacitated, leading to the infertility of the land. As a result, the king could not rule but only fish in the sterile Lakes, suffering from pain and exhaustion. In Irish mythology, a Bard was tasked to create a fierce Satire that would force the failed king off the throne. However, in Arthurian romance, knights have sought the holy Grail as a means to lift the curse of perpetual winter.
