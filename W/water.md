Fresh water was seen as sacred by the Celts, regardless of whether it was flowing through rivers and springs or still in lakes and wells. As a people who revered nature as a source and dwelling place of divinity, they recognized the importance of water as a vital component of the ecosystem. Water often acts as a boundary between this world and the Otherworld, with fairies residing in cities at the bottom of lakes or on islands in the middle of rivers. Water from holy wells, which were primarily dedicated to a saint or a minor deity, was considered to have healing properties. The Scottish folkloric figure known as the Water Bull, or Tarbh Uisge, was unfriendly to humans and guarded the entrance to Fairy Mounds or palaces. Similarly, the Water Horse, also known as Aughisky, Agh-iski, Eachuisge, or Each Uisge, was a terrifying creature emerging from the depths of lakes or oceans, resembling the most powerful and robust horse ever seen. If one mounted the water horse, unable to resist the temptation to ride as fast as the wind, they would soon regret it. The water horse galloped away so fast that the rider would suffocate from a lack of breath or plunge back into the water, drowning the victim. Even more malicious were the water horses that grazed quietly by a riverside with no bridge. If an unwary traveler attempted to ride the horse to keep their clothes dry, they found themselves halfway across the river and the water horse would dive down and attempt to drown them. It was crucial for those daring enough to approach such fatal creatures to pay attention to one important detail: the water horse must always face inward, away from the water. Once he caught a glimpse of the water, the rider’s destiny would be sealed. The water horse was particularly cunning, capable of adopting forms other than that of a horse. At times, it would take the guise of a defenseless maiden or a dashing young man. However, if you extended a hand in aid, the creature immediately transformed into a ferocious monster intent on devouring you alive. (It was therefore advised to inspect the grins of any humans encountered in aquatic locations; any speck of green vegetation wedged between their teeth was a sign that the water horse had been grazing and shapeshifted upon your arrival.) Humans were not their sole targets; the water horses also preyed upon cattle. As a result, it was hazardous to leave a herd unattended on the shore of a lake. From time to time, they inexplicably left the remains of their victims in the fields which were then discovered by bereaved relatives and puzzled herdsmen. Killing a water horse was nearly impossible, but according to legend, if you managed to ensnare the creature and hoist it above a flame—no easy feat given the monster's heft—it would transform into a pool of slime. Some tales suggest that all lakes were the remnants of ancient water horses that had melted away upon their demise. Check also Cabyll-Ushtey.
