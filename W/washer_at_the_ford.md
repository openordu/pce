A folkloric figure of Irish and Scottish origin, the washer at the ford (also known as the bean nigh, bean nighe, washer-wife, or washing fairy), is considered to be a Banshee or death prophet. Usually seen before a death, this spectral woman can be found washing the clothes of the soon to-be-deceased in a river, stream, or small pool. Passersby could hear the splashing sounds of her slapping at the laundry in the cold water. She wears green garments and has red webbed feet, and despite it being conveyed that she could be the ghost of an unfinished laundress and a death prophet, most people agree that she is a member of the Fairy race. As is the case with others of her kind, the washer had prescience and could see things in the future beyond imminent death. Therefore, if someone catches a glimpse of her before she catches sight of them, they could demand a prophecy. These prophecies were always accurate, however, spying on the washer was a risky endeavour since she could injure anyone caught in the act by waving her washing and inflict broken bones. The washer commonly emerged before battles and had a considerable amount of work to do when that happened. The more brutal the battle, the bigger her workload. Due to this association with the war goddess Badb and the phantom queen Mórrígan.
