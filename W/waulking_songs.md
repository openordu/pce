Songs sung during the process of "waulking" or shrinking wool to make it waterproof contain mythological and folkloric references, making them a prominent folkloric motif. Due to the conservative nature of oral tradition, the content of these songs is often ancient. However, with the advent of mechanical looms and wool processing machines, the tradition of women's singing during this process has declined significantly. Nevertheless, some contemporary artists such as Scotland's Capercaille have recorded and made available some of these heavily rhythmic songs that have been passed down over time.
