Mullo is a god in Continental Celtic mythology who is sometimes associated with the Roman god of war, Mars. It remains a matter of debate whether his name means “mule” or “wall,” and there is no consensus on the interpretation of the term. Mullo is often depicted with a Ramheaded Snake, indicating that he may have been worshipped as a deity of Healing.
