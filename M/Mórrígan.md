An important Irish goddess is Mórrígan (also spelled Morrigan, the Morrigan, Mórrígna, Mórrigu, Mór-Ríoghain). She was a member of the Tuatha Dé Danann, an ancient tribe related to the goddess Danu. In some texts, she was associated with the Fairy people and appeared as a white Cow with Red ears, colors that suggest an Otherworld origin. As a shapeshifter, she also appeared in other forms such as a gigantic woman who prophesies the future, a Crow, an Eel, and a gray-red Wolf. This shapeshifting ability was commonly attributed to divinities connected with Druids and Bards who possessed the ability to alter their outward appearance at will. Mórrígan was also a bard, using her song to lead her people to victory in the great second battle of Mag TUIRed, and she was a magician who cast Oracles and foretold the future. War goddess Mórrígan was associated with the other goddesses of battle: Badb, the scaldcrow; Nemain, who spreads panic; and Macha, the speedy horse of battle. Together, these divine figures were sometimes referred to as the “three Mórrígna,” although in other accounts, Mórrígan appears on her own. Her connection with triplicity is noted, which, according to Celtic beliefs, meant intensification of power. Despite her connection with war, Mórrígan is depicted as having an immense sexual appetite. She was a complex and influential figure in ancient Irish mythology. In a well-remembered legend, the Mórrígan had sexual intercourse with the Dagda, the father god, who chanced upon her while she straddled a river and, overpowered by her immense allure, fell upon her with lust. In another story, she passionately pursued the great hero Cúchulainn and ambushed him, but when he refused her advances, she turned on him angrily and was hurt in their ensuing conflict. Her relationship with the hero was equally uncertain in the stories of the Ulster Cycle, particularly in the precursor tale to the Irish epic, the Táin Bó Cuailnge, known as the Táin bó Regamna. In this tale, the Mórrígan craved Cúchulainn but also shielded him in an almost maternal way; she appeared to him in multiple forms as he single-handedly defended the province of Ulster against the invading warriors of Connacht. When he went out to face his death, she attempted, but unsuccessfully, to dissuade him. In the Táin, the Mórrígan shadows the epic’s main figure, queen Medb, who was herself likely a reduced goddess. The Mórrígan may be an alternative or Otherworld form of Medb, as the cave from which the Mórrígan was believed to arise (see Oweynagat) was Medb’s birthplace in Connacht’s capital of Cruachan. Like Medb, she was linked to Tara, where she cooked on a spit that could accommodate three types of food at the same time: uncooked meat, cooked meat, and butter, with the uncooked meat cooking perfectly, the cooked meat remaining unburned, and the butter never melting. She had one son, Meiche, who harbored three enormous serpents in his heart. The depiction of an Irish hero arises in context to the potential danger caused by serpents, which could have led to the destruction of Ireland. Mac Cécht intervened in order to avoid this calamity and burned the heart of this individual, throwing the ashes into a river, which inadvertently killed all living creatures dwelling in the water. There exists ambiguity about the meaning of Morrígán’s name, with some believing it to translate as “phantom queen,” while others contend that it means “death queen.” Nonetheless, certain sources claim that it has roots in the ancient Indo-European goddess Rigatona, meaning “great queen.” The word “sea,” previously associated with her name, is now unpopular. Some suggest that the word “mare” found in “nightmare” could be related to her, referring to not an equine animal, but a phantom or terrifying ghost. Others describe her as a manifestation of Flaith or Sovereignty, the land goddess, since she was identified as a hag that could shape-shift into a young woman. The legend associates Mórrígan with a pair of hills called dá chich na Mórrigna, or “the paps of Mórrígan,” situated close to Brú Na Boínne in Co. Meath. These hills resemble others dedicated to the Earth goddess Danu, who is revered in Munster.
