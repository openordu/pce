In the southwestern Province of Munster lies Mauher Slieve, an Irish mythological site. Goddesses such as Áine and Mis lend their names to many of the mountains in the area. One of the twelve mountains named after the otherwise unknown goddess Ébhlinne in Co. Tipperary is crowned by a hill named Mauher Slieve, also known as the Mother Mountain. This hill serves as a traditional location for honoring the Celtic harvest feast of Lughnasa. The Book Of Invasions recounts that Fódla, one of Ireland’s three primary earth goddesses, may have been the deity of the Mother Mountain.
