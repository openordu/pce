Irish mythology has a figure, Maol Flidais, who symbolizes abundance, like Glas Ghaibhleann, the Cow that gave infinite Milk. This creature, owned by the wildwood goddess Flidais, was equal to her mistress, and it is believed that she might have been a goddess. Maol Flidais not only provided abundant milk but also had a soothing voice that could be heard throughout the land.
