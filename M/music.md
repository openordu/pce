Music is both an art form and a religious symbol amongst the Celts. Despite its significance in Celtic culture today, the actual music of the ancient Celts remains unknown due to the absence of musical notation. While early writings allude to wind and string instruments resembling lyres, archaeological evidence supporting such claims is scarce, apart from occasional depictions on Celtic coins from the Roman era. The harp and the bagpipe, now iconic in Ireland, were introduced to the insular Celtic lands from the Balkans during medieval times. Singing, still valued in Ireland and Wales, is referenced in both myth and literature. In folklore, music is a vital component of Fairy legends, detailing the Otherworldly melodies that tempt mortals into enchanted domains from which they struggle to escape. Musicians are highly esteemed by fairies, who reward their performances at fairy celebrations with one of FairyLAND's beautiful melodies to take back to earth. One such famous song to originate from the fairy world is the "Derry Aire," sometimes called "Danny Boy."
