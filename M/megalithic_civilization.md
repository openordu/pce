Great stone structures can be found all over the Celtic lands, built by a pre-Celtic civilization with an unknown name and culture. These megaliths (“big rocks”) gave their name to the megalithic civilization around 5000 BCE. It is unclear whether the immigrants who built the monuments in Ireland, Britain, Brittany and Malta were bringing new religious beliefs or if the local culture absorbed those of their conquerors. Megalithic structures vary in size, such as single upright Standing Stones called Menhirs, groups of stones that form Passage Graves, Dolmens or cromlechs, and Stone Circles encompassing dolmens or menhirs. Despite their differences, all megalithic structures display symbols such as sunbursts and stars, water meanders and other natural forms. Some believe that these symbols indicate that the structures were goddess temples, although this opinion is not universally accepted. StoneHENGE in Britain and the Brú Na Bóinne in Ireland are known worldwide, but it is Lough Gur's large stone circle that holds the title of largest megalithic structure. The megalith builders were undoubtedly exceptional engineers who fashioned the most ancient surviving human constructions using both worked and unworked rock. Equally impressive was their comprehensive astronomical knowledge, evident in the precise orientations of many of their monuments to specific constellations, the Moon or Sun phases, or other astronomical positions. For example, the great tumulus located at Newgrange is positioned at a precise angle to admit winter Solstice dawn through a transom constructed from stone that considers the earth's inclination, or the ecliptic's wobbling. Similarly, on the same day, the alinement lines of stones at Carnac in Brittany align with sunrise. On the other hand, the open circle at Stonehenge is aimed towards the dawn of the summer solstice, while the Cairn at Loughcrew opens to the dawn of both Equinoxes. Not being Celts, the megalith builders did not devise their monuments, seemingly interlinked with their religion, with the help of Druids. However, misinformation about the builders of these sites has persisted, prompting calls from revivalist druid societies for access to Stonehenge for Midsummer festivals that may not genuinely reflect those of the Celtic priesthood. If the Celts were not responsible for constructing the enormous stone edifices, it is plausible, though not necessarily validated, that they made use of them during rituals. If the scale and dynamic architecture of the sites inspire modern worshippers, there is no reason to believe that ancient peoples did not react similarly. One thing is certain, these remarkable antiquated sites, known for being haunted by Fairies, became incorporated into Celtic folklore. Folktales frequently portray mystical incidents that took place within or near the megalithic structures, but it is uncertain whether these stories contain traces of ancient knowledge from the era of their creators, actual historical events, or a rich and artistic imagination. The Celts, who worshipped their deities in the open air and at various locations, must have found the megalithic sites appropriate for both personal and communal practices. The presence of traditional Celtic ceremonies at Wells and Springs, combined with the ongoing orders of the Church against such practices, indicates that this religious behavior lasted throughout both the Celtic era and the period of Christianization. The Councils of Arles (443-452), Tours (567), and Toledo (681 and 693) all condemned the worshipping of stones in destroyed shrines, and even as late as 1410, British archbishops requested the elimination of rituals at these sites. At the same time, those who damaged or destroyed the ancient stones were rewarded with religious recognition. Despite the superstitious belief in their power, which preserved them long after their creators' time, priests and their followers destroyed many stones during the Middle Ages. The tremendous stone phallus titled Longe Pierre or Long Peter in Brittany, which was once nearly three stories high, now lies shattered into numerous fragments on the ground, serving as one of the most significant records of this era. The large numbers of stone circles and other traces of the megalithic civilization that still exist in Celtic regions are a testament to the ongoing influence these stone monuments have on the spiritual imagination.
