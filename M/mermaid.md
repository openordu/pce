Half-human, half-fish beings known as mermaids (also referred to as Merrow, Morrough, Moruach, Moruadh, Maighdean-mara, Ben-Varrey or Mary Morgan) are a common figure in both continental and insular folklore. Celtic lands, spanning from the west coast of Ireland to France, feature tales of this mystical creature, with the most frequently portrayed version being the female mermaid. However, male merfolk are occasionally mentioned. These beings shared attributes with other half-human entities including Swan Maidens and Seal people. In addition, mermaids possessed special powers. They were sea Fairies, creatures from the Otherworld, who would swim in shallow coastal waters with the intent of luring humans towards their death. In some stories, mermaids were attracted to human men which made them typical Fairy Lovers. They would sing sweet melodies, causing anyone who heard them to fall asleep, hence drowning in the water. This aspect of mermaids has been linked with the death-messenger, the classical siren, who is depicted both as a bird and a singing maiden. Unlike the majority of fairy mistresses, mermaids were not always beautiful. They could have Green teeth or Red noses or Pig eyes. Their hair, made of seaweed or kelp, could be green and scraggly. Despite this, they were still able to capture the attention of many men, so sailors were cautioned to be wary of them. If mermaids spotted you before you noticed them, you were caught for sure. There are stories that indicate that mermaids were particularly fond of brandy. They would work together and lure ships carrying this drink to their demise so they could search for unbroken bottles among the wreckage. Excessive indulgence was attributed to the red nose sported by many mermen. Every mermaid had a Cohuleen Druith, a little cap, which allowed her to safely swim beneath the waves and live in reefs without danger. It was highly important for a human man who wished to take a mermaid as his wife to steal her cap and keep it safely hidden, just as Swan Maidens’ feather cloaks and Seal Women’s fur coats had to be kept from their view. If a mermaid found her cap, she would put it on and escape from land, without a thought or a second glance, leaving her husband and children behind. However, as long as she remained ashore, the mermaid was an industrious, loving, and sensuous wife, making the risk of her loss worth taking and her abandonment devastating. The mermaid had various manifestations throughout the coastal Celtic lands, with Cornwall having its own version of the mermaid. An ancient sea-goddess, who holds a mirror and is possibly influenced by classical interpretations of the seaborne Aphrodite, Greek goddess of lust and love, was cloaked as a mermaid in Cornwall. The Mermaid of Zennor is the most famous manifestation of the mermaid in Cornwall. In a small coastal village in Penwith, a girl emerged from the ocean to entice the best singer from the church’s choir, Matthew Trenwalla, to share her home and love in the depths. Her image can now be observed in the village’s church. In Brittany, the mermaid was inclined to capture young men and keep them imprisoned underwater, invariably resulting in their death from drowning. Mermaids in England were not only associated with the ocean, but also with freshwater. The Lake Maidens were said to inhabit only pools and still water, rather than running water. Interestingly, the first syllable in their name which seems to mean “sea” actually comes from the Old English word “meer”, which means “lake” or “inland sea”. In Manx mythology, mermaids were famous for their irresistible allure. They would entice potential lovers by holding out beautiful treasures from the sea such as coral, pearls, or even precious jewels from sunken ships. If the potential mate came to his senses before leaping to his death and ran away from the mesmerizing mermaid, she would throw stones at him. If she managed to hit him, he was ultimately doomed to die despite being on dry land. In Scotland, there was a legend of the Maighdean-mara, a being that was half fish and half woman. She only appeared on offshore rocks near dawn or late at night, while combing her beautiful hair. At first glance she appeared entirely human, but upon closer inspection, she had no legs and possessed a tail similar to that of a fish. She could, however, shake off her tail, assuming a human form. This made her appear entirely human and she could be very helpful to humans, which was not typical of mermaids. The Scottish islands were home to many mermaid stories. On the Isle of Skye, it was believed that people with fair hair were descendants of mermaids. The Morrow, MacMorrow, MacCodrums, and MacMurray families were said to be living relatives of these mermaids. Additionally, in the 1890s, a mermaid was said to have appeared off the northern coast of Scotland in Orkney. Her milk-white body, unnaturally tiny head, and long arms made her visible from the shore. The mermaids in the Hebrides were not believed to have possessed a magical cap as in other places, but a magical belt which had to be taken from them to tame them. Their descendants were said to possess the ability (or curse) of foretelling who would perish at sea. Some people in the Shetlands claimed to be mermaid descendants, citing a small membrane between their fingers and toes as proof, which is actually an uncommon natural physical mutation. In Brittany, mermaids took on the form of sirens and lured men to their death in treacherous waters. A pagan princess named Dahut was their leader and sang beautifully to sailors passing by as she floated above her sunken city of Ys. However, men who ventured too close to her drowned in the turbulent waves. Dahut, whose story describes her deadly affection toward men, may have been a mermaid before being portrayed as a princess, or the other way around. It was once believed in some parts of Brittany that all mermaids were daughters of Dahut. In Irish literature, the moruadh or moruach ("seamaid") has been acknowledged since ancient times. Mermaids played in the waves as the Milesians approached the shore in the Book of Invasions. Additionally, the Annals of the Four Masters narrate the mermaids as Giants: 195 feet long, with 7 feet long fingers and hair measuring 18 feet. The moruadh was usually a playful and alluring creature who mated with humans on a regular basis. The descendants of mermaids from the Lee family never drowned. In The Bride of Lammermoor, Sir Walter Scott recounted the tale that consuming water from a mermaid's well proved fatal, specifically for those from the House of Ravenswood. In her literary appearances, the mermaid has been featured in various stories. However, the most famous of these is in the story of "The Little Mermaid" by Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen. Despite being an invention of the author and never a part of folklore, the story captures the pains that the mermaid had to endure in order to have her tail transformed into legs. This depiction has achieved significant recognition partially due to the Disney film adaptation that shares the same name. Another contemporary representation of this mythological creature is shown in the film "Local Hero" by Scottish director William Forsythe. In this production, the mermaid is presented as an enigmatic figure, a goddess of Sovereignty who safeguards her land.
