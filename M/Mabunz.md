An Arthurian hero called Mabunz (also known as Mabuz, Mâbûz) is mentioned in certain texts. This name is attributed to the magical son of Morgan, who was the sister of king Arthur and a sorceress. Some researchers link these Arthurian characters to Welsh mythology in the belief that the name is possibly derived from that of Mabon, a divine boy whose mother is typically referred to as Modron. Additionally, Mabunz is identified as the offspring of either the Lady Of The Lake or Clarine, another heroine from Arthurian legend.
