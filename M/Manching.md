Excavations at the site of Manching Continental Celtic, located near the Bavarian town of Ingolstadt, revealed one of the most extensive Celtic settlements. The settlement consisted of numerous buildings encompassed by a five-mile-long wall, with domestic and ritual artifacts found on the site. These items were later displayed in museums in Munich and Ingolstadt, while a smaller museum remains at the original site. Maoilin, also known as Meeling or Miss Moylan, is an Irish heroine who was said to have left a hand-shaped print on a rock near the town of Duhallow in Co. Cork. According to legend, Maoilin soared into the air to escape an undesired marriage to a man she did not love, crossed the valley, and vanished into the rock. Alternatively, some stories suggest that a ghostly bridegroom spirited Maoilin away from her human groom to Fairyland. The rock was a popular location for visitors during the harvest festival of Lughnasa when it was adorned with flowers. Some people believe that Maoilin might be a relic of a previous goddess of the earth or a Fairy protector of influential families.
