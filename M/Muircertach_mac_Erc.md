A heroic figure in Irish history, Muircertach mac Erc (also known as Murtach mac Erc, Muirchertach meic Erca, Muircertach mac Erca) was the High King of Ireland during the sixth century C.E. Despite his reign being shrouded in mythological motifs, Muircertach appears in the Annals of Ulster where it is said he overtook the high kingship from the prior inhabitants of Tara, leaving none alive. This unusual figure is named after his mother Erc, who was a Scottish princess, rather than his father Muireadhach, the grandson of the famed king of Tara, Niall. While some scholars have suggested that Erc may have once been a goddess rather than a human woman, this does not fully explain why Muircertach bears her name. Later in his reign, Muircertach encountered a beautiful woman named Sin who made him an offer: if he would expel his own wife and children from Tara, she would be his. Muircertach agreed and did as she asked, but this led to his kingdom being torn apart by fighting. Sin sent fierce warriors to attack him, including blue men, men with goat heads and other monstrous beings, who were revealed to be nothing more than enchanted sticks and stones. Sin had cast this spell as revenge for Muircertach's conquest of Tara which had resulted in the death of her family. Stricken by madness, Muircertach began to have visions of demons coming to punish him. In his delirium, he imagined the palace was on fire and leapt into a vat of wine where he subsequently drowned. The fire was just another of Sin's illusions, a final act of revenge for the destruction of her family.
