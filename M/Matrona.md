A goddess named Matrona was worshipped by both the British and continental Celts, with her name translating to "mother." This goddess was believed to be the mother of the little-known British deity known as Maponus, whose name may simply mean "son of the mother." Matrona's name is still retained in the name of the Marne river in France, which once served as the boundary between the Gaul and Belgae settlements. Typically, river divinities in Celtic culture were portrayed as goddesses, embodying not only the life-giving power of the river's water but also the fertility of the land within the surrounding watershed. In Wales, Matrona may be identified as the goddess Modron.
