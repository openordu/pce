In the second branch of the Mabinogion, a remarkable compilation of Welsh myths, we come across Matholwch, the Irish hero who attempted to build a stronger relationship with the Celtic individuals across the Irish Sea in Wales, by weding Branwen, the charming young princess of the Welsh land. Unfortunately, once they arrived back in Ireland, he treated her cruelly because her half-brother Efnisien had injured his horses. Despite Branwen giving birth to their baby, Gwern, Matholwch abused her both physically and verbally, until her heroic brothers Brân The Blessed and Manawydan gathered an army to liberate her. In an attempt to trap the warriors from Wales, Matholwch organized a banquet where fighters were concealed, mimicking sacks of grain, all over the dining hall. However, Efnisien recognized the threat and killed the infiltrators. In the ensuing battle, Brân and all but seven of the Welsh heroes lost their lives, though they took all the Irish fighters with them to their demise, including Matholwch. Upon her return to Wales, Branwen died from a broken heart due to the chaos wrought by her unhappy situation.
