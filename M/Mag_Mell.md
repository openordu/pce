Irish mythology has a place referred to as Mag Mell (or Magh Meall), which is often regarded as a description of the Otherworld. It is described as a plain of delights and honey, where one can experience everlasting joy and everything is sweet. In this fairyland, trees bloom and bear fruits simultaneously, and there is no pain or death. Despite the name of the place, it is not actually on land, but rather a floating island that belongs to the sea god, Manannán Mac Lir.
