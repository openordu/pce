Arthurian hero Mordred, who also goes by Modred, Modreuant, Medrawd, or Medrawt, is known for being the illegitimate son of King Arthur and Morgause, Arthur’s half-sister, through the aid of the magician Merlin. Unlike his father, Mordred was stingy, cunning, and cowardly. In contrast to Arthur’s magnanimity and bravery, Mordred was his opposite. Nonetheless, it was Mordred who ultimately toppled the grand Camelot dream and the Round Table. Although Celtic myth established the foundation for the legends surrounding King Arthur, imaginative writers and poets elaborated upon them throughout numerous generations, molding the framework of the story to paint captivating human character profiles. Geoffrey of Monmouth set the standards of Mordred's persona, as Arthur's adversary, in the 12th century. Prior to this portrayal, Mordred acted as the Welsh hero, Medrawd, who passed away valiantly in the Battle of Camlan. Following his inclusion into Arthurian Legends as the king's son and foe, Mordred was cataloged in the Welsh Triads as one of the “Three Dishonored Men of the Island of Britain”.
