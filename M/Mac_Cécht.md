A farmer and husband of one of the goddesses of the land, Fódla, Mac Cécht was a minor Irish divinity, who belonged to the magical race referred to as the Tuatha Dé Danann. Both Mac Cécht and Fódla were possibly deities of agriculture since Fódla’s name meant “divided” or “plowed” land, and Mac Cécht’s similar name indicated “son of the plow” or “plowman.” Water was commonly viewed as a source of healing by the Celts, and Mac Cécht may have also been a god of Healing, as he walked across the barren land seeking water to revive the dying king of the Tuatha Dé, and a wild Duck led him to a spring.

Mac Cécht had another parallel identity as a hero who fought for the ill-fated King Conaire at Da Derga’s hostel, where he slew the person who beheaded the king and then offered his head a drink before he passed away in a fatal battle with one of the invading Milesians. Mac Cécht was also the son of Ogma, the god of eloquent speech, and was part of a trio of parallel gods, Mac Cuill and Mac Gréine, who were the husbands of the three land goddesses.
