Irish folklore speaks of the site of Mag Muirthemne as the potential dwelling place of the prominent Ulster hero, Cúchulainn. Located south of modern-day Dundalk (known as Dún Delgan in Irish), this plain has served as a residential area for Cúchulainn, even though his stronghold is more commonly thought to be situated in the town itself.
