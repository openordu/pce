Morgause, a renowned figure in Arthurian mythology, was the daughter of Igraine and the Duke of Cornwall, Gorlois. In an effort to produce a king with Igraine, only achievable through Uther Pendragon's heroism, Merlin enchanted Uther to look like Igraine's husband, leading to the adulterous conception of Arthur. Morgause, along with her sister Morgan, were born to Igraine and Gorlois and became Arthur's bitter enemies. Strangely, Morgause was also Arthurâ€™s lover, without their knowledge or consent, due to Merlin's meddling. When Arthur realized that he had impregnated his half-sister, who bore Mordred, his eventual murderer, he attempted to kill all the progeny conceived at that time. Morgause, however, saved her child by fleeing to far Orkney, where she married King Lot. Her son, Mordred, learned to despise his father/uncle through Morgause, and together they plotted to bring down Camelot. It is commonly mistaken and difficult to distinguish Morgause from her sister Morgan due to the similarity in their names, personalities, and staunch opposition to Arthur. It is believed that they were possibly one person originally.
