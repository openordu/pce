Gender relations within the culture of the Celts is currently an area of contention in modern research. Some scholars pose the question of whether or not Celtic women during that time were truly free or if such notions are simply projections by scholars imagining an idealistic culture without strict gender stereotyping. Certain scholars argue that the Celtic world may have been one in which women held more rights and power, even if it came with greater obligations. An indication of this possibility lies in the prevalence of mythological heroes in Celtic lands who bear their mother’s names, rather than their father’s names. For instance, in Ireland there is the king of Ulster, Concobar Mac Nessa, whose mother is Nessa, and the king of Connacht, Ailill mac Máta, whose mother is the woman Máta. Additionally, there is the heroic figure Diarmait Ua Duibne, whose name translates as “Dermot, descendant of the ancestral mother Dubinn,” as well as a race of people called the Tuatha Dé Danann, who are known as the “people of the goddess Danu.” In Wales we find Mabon vab Modron, which means “Son, son of Mother,” and king Math, whose throne was inherited by his sister’s son (Gwydion, son of DÔN), who was succeeded by his sister’s son Lleu Llaw Gyffes. All of these examples suggest a matrilineal inheritance. Tracing descent through the motherline instead of patrilineal or father-line succession does not necessarily mean women held more rights or power, yet it indicates the existence of different gender relations during the relevant periods of history. Scholars have suggested that matriliny may be a remnant of the cultural organization of the pre-Celtic people known as the Picts, as many of the figures mentioned above date back to early mythological times.
