The folkloric and mythological site referred to as the menhir is commonly known as a Standing Stone. Erected by the enigmatic Megalithic Civilization approximately 6,000 years ago, it consists of a single stone often of remarkable size. These stones were sometimes shaped and carved, but typically, they were left unaltered. The means by which the people of this ancient society transported the menhirs from their original locations, sometimes many miles away, to their final resting places, and then raised them into position continues to be the subject of much speculation.
