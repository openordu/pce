Central Ireland's Mound of the Hostages, a site of Irish mythology, is situated on the Hill of Tara, also known as "royal Tara" because of its links to historical High Kings of the land, and is a small tumulus with an artificial mound of earth built atop a Passage Grave constructed of stone. This location is linked to the renowned king Niall of the Nine Hostages. The usage of the term "hostages" here might lead to the erroneous belief that individuals were kept against their will. It would be more of an accurate reflection to use the word "fosterers" since the nine young men mentioned here willingly visited Niall's royal seat to bind their families to him.
