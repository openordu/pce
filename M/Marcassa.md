There is a Breton folktale about a heroic woman named Marcassa Breton. The tale takes place in the distant castle of the princess Marcassa, where a magical bird with a cure for the land's sick ruler resides. The protagonist of the story is prince Luduenn, who takes it upon himself to retrieve the bird and save the king. Luduenn's older brothers had attempted the same feat and disappeared. In search of the bird, Luduenn discovered his brothers living extravagantly in a distant city. They stole from Luduenn and left him with nothing, but he remained determined to find Marcassa's palace. Eventually, he did and found the bird caged in gold. However, Luduenn succumbed to temptation first and stole some self-replenishing bread and kissed the sleeping princess, Marcassa, in the process. Little did he know, the kiss impregnated her. One year later, Marcassa went in search of the father and encountered Luduenn's evil brothers. They had stolen her bread, and she realized that she was on the right path. Marcassa found the bird at the palace, but it had not helped the king, as it had been too anxious without her. When Marcassa returned, the bird soon sang joyously, which resulted in the king's recovery. When Marcassa informed the king about what she had learned about Luduenn's older brothers and how they had mistreated him, the king killed them and appointed Marcassa and Luduenn as queen and king. No self-references or topic introductions were employed in the writing style of Nora Chadwick, who would simply delve into the subject matter. In accordance with this, it can be stated that the tale at hand is notably similar to the Scottish folktale of Brian and Dér Gréine.
