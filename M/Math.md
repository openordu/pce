In Welsh mythology, there exists a character known as Math fab Mathonwy, who is believed to be a hero or a god. The fourth branch of the Mabinogion, a collection of Welsh mythological texts, is named after this figure. According to the story, King Math of Gwynedd had a ceremonial handmaiden named Goewin, who was raped. The narrative mainly focuses on Math's efforts to find a replacement for Goewin, who should be a virgin to keep Math's magical safety intact. It was a customary kind of kingly taboo or Geis observed in Celtic lands that the king was never supposed to set foot on the ground. For example, the king of Tara in Ireland was not allowed to spend more than eight nights away from home. Math's character appears to be quite dubious and rather unpleasant. He conspired with his nephew Gwydion to reveal the secrets of Gwydion's sister Arianrhod. He even assisted in creating an artificial bride for Arianrhod's son, Lleu Llaw Gyffes, to prevent the curse that prophesized he would never find a wife, and his heir was his nephew rather than his son. This goes on to support the supposition that in ancient Welsh culture, matrilineal succession, succession through the mother, was more prevalent.
