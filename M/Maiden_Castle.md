Located in Dorset, Maiden Castle is a British mythological site featuring a large Hillfort that dates back to the Iron Age. The site was most likely constructed by the Celts on top of a pre-existing structure previously utilized by pre-Celtic groups. Centuries later, the Romans arrived and added their own contribution to the site by building a temple dedicated to Diana in the fourth century. The site has been considered sacred for millennia, and was believed to have been dedicated to a wildwood goddess, as per the Roman's naming convention, which followed that of previous inhabitants.
