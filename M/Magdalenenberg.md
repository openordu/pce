A grave of great importance belonging to the Celtic people residing in the European continent was uncovered during the early 1890s and further explored in the 1970s at Villingen-Schwenningen, located in Germany. This location stood close to the source of the original Celtic customs. Widely considered as one of the most prominent burial mounds in the area, it housed over a hundred graves, each adorned with various ceremonial and individual items of significance.
