Ireland is traditionally divided into four parts: Leinster to the east, the Province of wealth; Connacht in the west, the province of wisdom; Ulster in the north, province of war; and Munster, located in the southwest, the province of music and song. Mide or Meath, on the other hand, symbolizes the center and is a mythological construct rather than a geographical one. Today Munster includes the counties of Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford and boasts of varied landscapes. Its fertile valleys are among the richest in Ireland, and its mountains are the highest in the island, each range and many individual mountains tied to goddesses. The Paps Of Danu, a pair of identical, breast-shaped mountains, are the most impressive of these mountains and are found in central Munster. They are topped with stone Cairns that form nipples. While the association with the goddess is throughout Ireland, it is most closely tied to the feminine principle in Munster. The region is the birthplace of many vital goddesses, including the Cailleach, Hag-like figure who is connected with the rocky Beare peninsula in the south of the province and the similarly rocky Burren in the north. The sea goddess Mór and Fairy Queen Áine, whose mountain is visible near Lough Gur, Ireland’s most haunted lake, also originate from this region. When the magical Salmon of Wisdom, Fintan, was asked to define the provinces, he defined Munster as song and celebration, poetry and festival, and the playing of games. Most importantly, Munster represents fertility, as only with sufficient food can people enjoy the creative arts. Most early humans arrived in Ulster, which is visible on clear days from Scotland and thus attracted early hunters and gatherers. However, Munster holds a legendary reputation as the landfall for invaders. Mythology showcases wave after wave of invaders arriving on Munster's rocky shores, even though archaeology tells us otherwise. Cesair landed at Dún na mBarc on the Dingle peninsula, where the Milesians also landed. It's possible that the currents from Europe that led to the medieval Spanish Armada's wreckage on the Munster coast brought early migrants, providing some validity to the legends.
