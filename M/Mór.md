The goddess or heroine known as Mór (also referred to as Mor or Mór Mumhan) is an Irish figure. Her name means “big” or “great,” and she is often considered as the land goddess of Munster Province in the southwest. Mór’s full title means “the great one of Munster,” and the word ‘Mór’ was frequently used to describe territorial goddesses. Like other ancient goddesses, Mór has become a mere figure of folk legends. The tale goes that a woman called Mór, accompanied by her husband, Lear (perhaps Lir, an early sea god), came to the promontory in Co. Kerry that today bears her name. There, they constructed a house near Mount Eagle, and from their abode they were provided with all their needs by the sea. (This legend recalls the stories of Mermaids who profited from spoils of ships they wrecked.) One day, Mór climbed to the mountain’s peak and saw, for the first time, the extent of the land in which she lived. While atop the mountain, Mór was suddenly struck by the need to urinate, and she relieved herself in a squatting position - a mythological motif that appears in numerous creation stories featuring goddesses. The ravines that run through the mountains of Munster are thought to have been formed by Mór’s gigantic streams of urine. Mór's joy turned into sadness when her children, whom she cherished greatly, fell into the temptation of trying their luck as sailors. As her happiness declined, so did her power; she gradually withered away in sadness. Her husband left her due to her terrible temper, sailing north and settling far away from his desolate wife. Local folklore reveals that the place where Mór came ashore, Dunmore Head, was also known as "Mary Geeran's house". In Irish, it is called Ty-Vor-ney Gerane, meaning Tigh Mhorie ni Greine or "the home of Mór, child of the Sun." Dunmore faces the setting sun, believed to be Mór on her throne, revealing a connection to a sun goddess. There is also a story about Mór going mad and being tamed by the king of the Munster stronghold of Cashel, a story similarly told about Mis, the goddess of the Slieve Mish mountains that cut through the peninsula where Mór resided. There is the possibility that the two were originally the same character. In the Scottish Highlands, a similar giant woman named Mór lived. She was believed to be the daughter of Smûid who was washed away in a flood while carrying a group of travelers on her back.
