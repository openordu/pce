A warrior named Colga of the Hard Weapons once sailed to Ireland with the aim of conquering the seagirt island that was the only one not under his control. However, he was faced with the Fianna, a group of heroic warriors with whom he was outnumbered. Despite the odds, the Fianna defeated Colga’s men and Oscar, one of the greatest among them, killed Colga himself. Colga had brought his young son, Midac, along with him on this expedition. The Fianna's leader, Fionn Mac Cumhaill, opted not to kill the boy as an enemy and instead decided to raise him as an Irishman in Almu. Midac was not able to forget the anguish he felt seeing his father die, and thus, he silently plotted for revenge. Fionn’s men realized that Midac was distant and sullen, and eventually convinced Fionn to send him away. Fionn did this by granting Midac rich lands in counties Limerick and Clare, as well as cattle and servants, hoping the young man would not want for anything. Fionn sent Midac away without much thought. Midac then lived peacefully for 14 years near the bright waters of the Shannon. However, during this time, the Fianna went hunting on Knockfierna, a Fairy hill near Midac’s land. A noble warrior approached them, dressed like a Danish warrior, and asked Fionn to answer some riddling poems. Fionn, being wise and quick-witted, was able to unravel the riddles but missed the young man's true identity. However, other Fianna warriors immediately recognized the young man as Midac. Midac had finally revealed his identity to the band, and extended an invitation to his palace for a banquet. The palace, surrounded by magical Rowan trees, was as splendid as it was silent and unoccupied. Undeterred, Fionn and his warriors entered the palace and made themselves comfortable in the grand banquet hall. Midac entered briefly, only to stare and depart without a word. It was then that Fionn and his warriors realised they had been deceived by a Glamour, and were now held captive in a crude shack. The Fianna warriors were summoned one by one to their rescue, with Diarmait eventually decapitating Midac. However, Fionn was still bound by a Curse; he wouldn't be free until the blood of Three foreign kings was sprinkled on its soil. Diarmait valiantly battled three armies and their kings, and emerged victorious after decapitating all three, finally dragging their Heads to Midac's palace. The kings’ blood struck the floor, turning it back into a rude shack. The folklore of entrapment in a bewitched palace is a common one.
