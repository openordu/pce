An Irish hero named Mac Dathó, also known as Mac Datho or Mes Roeda. In the Ulster Cycle tale Scéla mucce Meic Dathó, Mac Dathó was a warrior who possessed a hunting hound named Ailbe, which was highly coveted by two kings: Concobar Mac Nessa of Ulster and Ailill mac Máta of Connacht. Mac Dathó, unable to choose between the two kings, invited both of them and their warriors to a feast, at which he served a huge roasted Pig. In accordance with the custom that the best portion of the feast be awarded to the finest champion (see Champion’s Portion), an argument ensued between the kings as to who should receive the honor. In the resulting commotion, Mac Dathó's hound Ailbe was killed, providing Mac Dathó with a solution to his dilemma.
