The merman, known as Dinny-Mara, Dooinney Marrey, or Dunya Mara in Irish and Scottish folk tales, is a mythical creature. While it is common for sea fairies to be depicted as half-fish females, mermen are also occasionally mentioned in folk tales and literature. In contrast to their female counterparts, mermen are often described as unattractive creatures with pig-like eyes and a bright red nose resulting from their consumption of brandy from shipwrecks. Their diet, consisting of raw fish, also contributes to their unsavory breath. According to the English historian Holinshed, during the reign of King John, a merman was captured and referred to as the Wild Man of Oxford. However, he did not live long in captivity.
