Mide, an Irish hero, was a geographical division in ancient Ireland. Ireland was divided into four provinces, namely Leinster, Munster, Connacht, and Ulster, with a fifth province referred to as Mide or Meath. The Indo-European worldview was a physical distribution into four areas with an invisible center as the fifth. During the reign of King Tuathal Teachmhair (130-160 C.E.), a county in the middle of the island was named Meath, which has since been referred to as "royal Meath" because the political center of the island (the hill of Tara) was located within it. The original Mide was, however, not a spiritual concept but a geographical one. The term Mide means "neck" and "middle," so it has been interpreted to signify the point of connection between the abstract idea of the land's Sovereignty (symbolizing the Head) and the physical land (the Body). This association took place on the hill of Uisneach in the center of the island, specifically at a cracked boulder on the hill known as the Stone Of Divisions, within the present-day Co. Westmeath. According to the place poetry of Ireland or Dindshenchas, Mide was not only a place, but also a person who was a Druid and the foster child of Ã‰riu, the goddess of the land. Mide lit the first fire either on or close to Uisneach. For seven years, the fire had burned relentlessly, sustained solely by offerings from all provinces in Ireland. However, when other druids voiced their objections on the seventh year to continuing to keep Mide's fire alight, he decided to take drastic measures. He gathered them together and removed their ability to speak by cutting out their tongues. Mide then buried their tongues in a nearby hill and sat atop them. Eventually, his teacher, the woman druid Gaine, christened the area "Uisneach," which means "over somewhat."
