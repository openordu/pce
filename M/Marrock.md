A figure of Arthurian folklore, Marrock was a hero who was also a werewolf. One peculiar trait of Marrock was that he needed human apparel to transform into his human form. One day, Marrock's wife, who desired to be with her lover, took away his clothes, depriving him of his human form, thus causing him to live as a wolf in the hills. It so happened that Marrock was fortunately encountered by King Arthur, who realized that he was under a spell. King Arthur brought Marrock to his home and while there, Marrock developed an amiable relationship with Arthur's wife. She later relented and returned Marrock's clothes which enabled him to reacquire his humanity and restore his marriage.
