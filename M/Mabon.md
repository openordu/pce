Mabon, also known as Mabon vab Modron or Mabon fab Modron, is a Welsh hero who is not very well-known. In the Arthurian story of Kulhwch and Olwen, he appears as a divine youth under the name Mabon vab Modron, which means "Son, son of Mother." It is unclear whether the absence of his father's name is to emphasize his matrilineal descent or because his father is insignificant. Another figure called Mabon vab Mellt may be the same person or a different god entirely, and his father's name is Mellts. In an earlier text, Mabon is referred to as "one of the Three Exalted Captives of the Island of Britain," which alludes to a story from the Welsh Mabinogion where he was rescued by the hero Kulhwch from the Otherworld after being held captive for many years. Mabon assisted Kulhwch in gaining the hand of his chosen mate Olwen. The motif of captivity appears to be fundamental to Mabon's myth, as two minor characters in Arthurian literature, Mabonagrain and Mabunz, are also held captive. Some have suggested that Mabon's name may be the origin of the name of the Mabinogion, a collection of Welsh myths, while others connect him to the obscure god Maponus. Despite being presumed to have once been an important figure, Mabon remains a baffling mystery.
