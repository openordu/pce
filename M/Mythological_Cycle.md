The Irish Mythological Cycle comprises a collection of texts and stories that recount the tales of Ireland's ancient divinities. The Book of Invasions tells the primary story of a competition between mythological races. The initial settlements made by the followers of Nemed and Partholón were not particularly noteworthy, and eventually, the Fomorians took over. These malevolent beings were twice defeated and pushed out by the Fir Bolg, who, in turn, were dethroned by the mysterious and powerful Tuatha Dé Danann, also referred to as the people of the goddess Danu, following the first battle of Mag Tuired. During this battle, the valiant King Nuada lost his arm, which rendered him disqualified from ruling since a Blemished King could not reign. Consequently, the half-Fomorian, half-Tuatha Dé Danann Bres assumed the throne, despite being known for his snide and selfish behavior, despite being incredibly beautiful. However, his refusal to provide enough rations for a poet resulted in his removal from the throne when Cairbre uttered a satire so biting that it caused boils to form on Bres’s face, thereby making him ineligible to rule. Meanwhile, the god of healing, Dian Cécht, along with his son, Miach, used their unique abilities to create a new hand for Nuada. Dian Cécht crafted a silver appendage, while Miach cast spells that caused skin to grow over the artificial limb. Nuada returned to the throne just in time to lead his people in another battle at the same spot where the previous one had taken place. The second battle of Mag Tuired began on the sacred feast of Samhain and saw the Tuatha Dé fight against the Fomorians, who were once again a formidable force, led by the terrifying Balor of the Evil Eye. Balor had only one function eye, using the other to cast deadly rays in times of war. A spear hurled by his own grandson, Lugh, who was of mixed ancestry, put an end to the life of the hero known as Balor. Following this incident, the Tuatha Dé Danann took over governing the territory until they were replaced by the Milesians much later on. It is important to note that this narrative is not included in the Mythological Cycle.
