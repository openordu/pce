Morgan, also known as Morgen, Morgan Le Fay, Morgan la fée, Morgaine, Morgana, Orva, Orna, Oua, Orains, Ornais, Morgain, Moruein, and Morganz, was an Arthurian heroine. King Arthur had many half-sisters, who were the children of his mother Igraine and her first husband, Duke Gorlois of Cornwall. There are two sisters, the sorceress Morgan and the ambitious queen Morgause, whose names are often confused due to their resemblances and questionable behaviors, and it is believed that they might have originally been the same figure. Morgan learned the art of magic while studying at a convent boarding school as a child, and according to some legends, she continued her studies with the renowned magician Merlin. As she developed her skills, she gained significant powers of enchantment. When spurned by her lover Guyomard, Morgan created the Perilous Valley, where any knight who was unfaithful to their lady would be ensnared by self-created illusions. She eventually wedded Urien, a minor king, and gave birth to Owein, who became a knight and married the enigmatic Lady of the Fountain in a romantic Arthurian story. While her brother was victorious in Camelot, Morgan endeavored to bring disaster upon Arthur and his court by stealing and ultimately destroying the enchanted scabbard of Excalibur, which shielded the king during combat. Despite this, at the end of his life on earth, Arthur was brought to Morgan, who was capable of taking him to the Otherworld for healing or death. Behind the enigmatic figure of legend lies a formidable being whose close relationship with the Otherworld is evidenced by her alternative name, Morgan Le Fay, which means “the Fairy” or, more significantly, “the fate.” Described in early texts as one of nine women inhabiting a Fortunate Isle, Morgan was believed to be the most beautiful of them all; her sisters were Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, and Thiten. She was known for attempting to seduce men, following in the tradition of many other Fairy Lovers. Although she set her sights on the noble knight Lancelot, she failed in her attempts. Morgan's origins may be tied to the Irish Mórrígan, a goddess of battle and death. Some believe she may have descended from a sea goddess since the name "Morgan" is associated with sea fairies in Brittany who often abduct human men. In Wales, lake spirits are referred to as Morgans, and according to medieval legend, Morgan was responsible for the Fata Morgana - a sea mirage that consists of palaces and columns, complete with its own water reflection.
