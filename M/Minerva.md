A Celtic goddess known as Minerva (or Minerva Medica) was incorporated into Roman religion. She was the goddess of healing, and although in Rome she merged with the Greek Athena, Minerva was not a warrior. Instead, she battled illnesses and suffering. In Celtic regions, the Romans discovered several goddesses with similar healing abilities that were believed to reside at the source of rivers, hot springs, and other bodies of water. One of these goddesses can be seen today through carvings in the Roman quarries of Chester near the River Dee, where she is portrayed with an owl and a Gorgon's head, both symbols of the Greek Athena. Julius Caesar claimed that the Celtic Minerva imparted humanity with knowledge of crafts and arts, but there is little evidence to support this assertion. Occasionally, the Celtic goddess was completely given a new name, thus losing her original one to history, whilst in other cases the Celtic moniker endured. One Minerva was known as Vitrix, signifying "victorious," and her helmeted female head is present in many relief carvings. Another was connected with Belisama, a goddess of war. The most notable Celtic Minerva was Sul, the goddess of the thermal springs located in the British city of Bath.
