The Milesians were a mythological race in Irish history that trace their descent from Míl Despaine, a hero whose name was derived from the Latin term “miles Hispaniae” or “soldier of Spain.” As narrated in the Book of Invasions, Míl Despaine belonged to the lineage of Noah's son Japheth, and his forefathers had wandered through Scythia and Egypt before arriving in Spain. Among his ancestors was Fénius the Ancient, who acted as an adviser in the construction of the Tower of Babel and was the only person who comprehended the babble of speech there. Fénius' descendant Goidel created the Irish language by amalgamating the various languages spoken at that time. Goidel was also bitten by a snake in Egypt, but he was cured by Moses, who prophesied that his descendants would reside in a land free of harmful serpents. After departing Egypt, the Irish returned to Scythia, only to encounter hostility from those who had remained. Thus, the group set sail once again, crossing the Caspian Sea on boats. En route, mermaids impeded their progress until they discovered that wax could be used to block their ears, allowing them to pass safely through the Mediterranean and reach the shores of Britain. One fine winter day, while climbing a high tower, Míl’s uncle Íth spied a hazy island in the west and decided to bring a group of settlers there. However, when Íth was slain in Ireland by the Tuatha Dé Danann, Míl sought revenge but died on the journey. Scota, the wife of Míl, together with her husband, initiated something that was continued by their sons, who ultimately managed to gain control over the whole island, but unfortunately, Scota was killed in battle. Their offspring, known as the Sons of Míl or Milesians, arrived as the last succeeding groups of people that settled on Irish shores, taking over the earlier gods and goddesses who were the children of Danu, the mother goddess. The majority of experts nowadays believe that there exists some veracity to the Irish legends, however, that truth is somewhat impaired over the course of transmission. According to these interpretations, the Milesians were the forefathers of the real-life Goidels. The stories of Egyptian and Scythian affiliations, and the Spanish relation itself, are widely regarded as fabrications of medieval writers who pondered on links between Scoti and Scythae, Iberians, and Hibernians.
