In Valenciennes during the Christian era, there was a French folkloric character known as Marie au Blè. As part of the ancient Celtic harvest feast of Lughnasa, young men would lead a girl dressed in white through the streets while dancing. The girl, referred to as "Mary of the Wheat," was accompanied by an attendant carrying a white cloth that displayed the first grains of harvested wheat. This festival, which is no longer practiced, seems to be a surviving tradition of Lughnasa in Continental Europe.
