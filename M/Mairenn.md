An Irish heroine by the name of Mairenn was married to a king of Tara who had two wives. Mairenn was known for always wearing an exquisite gold headdress. The other wife, Mugain, was jealous of the jewellery but also suspicious that Mairenn was hiding something. Her instincts were confirmed when a woman jester, bribed by Mugain, pulled off Mairenn's headdress revealing that she was bald underneath. Mairenn cursed Mugain, but in doing so her head was instantly covered with beautiful golden locks, hiding her shame. Due to her jealousy, Mugain faced a difficult time as she was forced to give birth to a lamb and a salmon before she could conceive a human child.
