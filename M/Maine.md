The Irish heroes, known as Maine (Maine, Mainí, The Manes), were minor characters who were the seven sons of queen Medb of Connacht and king Ailill mac Máta, all bearing the same name. A legend recounts how Medb wished for the death of her enemy, king Concobar mac Nessa of Ulster, and a Druid prophesied that her son Maine would accomplish this. Unfortunately, none of her sons bore that name, so she renamed them all. Of these, Maine Mórghor, previously called Sin, accompanied by a group of warriors, undertook the courtship of the maiden Fearbh, daughter of Gearg, while staying at Gearg’s home. A sudden, ominous wind arose, forewarned by Maine’s Druid. Simultaneously, Concobar encountered a Otherworldly woman who led him to Gearg’s abode. There, the host and Maine Mórghor were slain. Although Medb had a vision of the situation, she was too late to save her son. Another hero named Maine was a Norse prince, who carried out the will of king Concobar mac Nessa when Noísiu, an errant hero, returned to Ireland with Deirdre, a doomed but beautiful woman. Noísiu was slain by Maine’s sword.
