Irish hero Mongán, who ruled in the seventh century C.E., was a partly mythical figure. Despite being a human king, he was believed to be the son of the sea god Manannán Mac Lir and inherited his Shape-Shifting skill along with the ability to travel between this world and the Otherworld. Mongán, which means “hairy fellow” (due to his birth with a full head of hair), was conceived when his divine father took the guise of a human king. This resembles the narrative of King Arthur's conception. Additionally, Mongán was said to be the reincarnation of Fionn Mac Cumhaill, an Irish hero, whose wife Gráinne eloped with Diarmait, drawing parallels with the tale of Guinevere and Lancelot. Thus, despite his historical reign, Mongán appeared to reflect an ancient Celtic fable about the goddess of Sovereignty.
