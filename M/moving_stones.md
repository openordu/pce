Stone Circles and other mystical monuments dot the Celtic lands, left behind by a mysterious pre-Celtic people. These sites are rich in traditions and folktales, though their origins—whether Celtic, pre-Celtic, or Christian—are impossible to determine. One such belief is that the stones in these circles were not immobile, but rather had the power to move around. This movement was said to occur during significant calendar points, such as the midsummer Solstice or the Celtic feast of Samhain, often at midnight or dawn. The stones would leave their fixed positions and travel across the countryside, sometimes even taking a dip in nearby lakes or rivers. In some cases, they would transform into dancing stones or simply roll around on the grass. After their brief moment of freedom, the stones would return to their original positions and remain there until their next excursion. (See Merry Maidens for more information on dancing stones.)
