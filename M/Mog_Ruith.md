A legendary figure in Irish mythology is Mog Ruith (Mug Ruith), a hero and Druid whose appellation “the wheel magician” assumes that he employed a wheel for divination. Many medieval Irish sources recount his myth; one such text claims that he journeyed to the eastern Mediterranean and encountered Simon Magus, a powerful magician. Mog Ruith subsequently complied with the edict of King Herod by beheading John the Baptist, a Christian martyr. As punishment for the ancient wrongdoing, Ireland suffered from famine and other disasters. Additional texts identify him as the father of enigmatic Tlachtga, whose name has been immortalized in a legendary location of note. Mog Ruith serves as Munster's primary Druid who performed a miraculous feat during a battle with enemy forces to secure his side's victory. Reportedly using an arrow or spear, he strikingly drilled a well that brought forth water. He then lit a fire employing Rowan tree wood, above which he proclaimed incantations until the smoke cleared and he foresaw triumph. Donning a cloak resembling a bird, Mog Ruith flew into the sky and challenged rival Druids, battling in mid-air while Munster’s troops defeated their enemies below.
