A mention of Modron (Madrun) can be found in Welsh mythological texts like the Mabinogion. She is a Welsh goddess whose name means "mother". This makes her comparable to the Deae Matres, known as "the divine mothers" in continental Celtic mythology, as well as Matrona, the mother goddess. There is little known mythology surrounding her, which has led some to speculate that she might have been an early or even pre-Celtic deity whose name outlived her narratives and rituals. Interestingly, in Cornwall, there is a saint named Madrun or Madron who may have been a Christianized version of the goddess. Rituals at St. Madrun's Well include dropping pins into the water in order to predict the future health of the petitioner.
