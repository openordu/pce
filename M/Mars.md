Mars was a Continental Celtic and British god. As the Roman legions conquered various Celtic tribes, the Interpretatio Romana was practiced whereby local deities were called by Roman names. This resulted in over 60 versions of Mars, originally known as the Roman god of agriculture but later becoming the god of war. This was because Roman fields needed protection by warriors against invaders who might take them over. While it is unclear if the Celts saw their Mars as similarly connecting war and agriculture, some inscriptions and sculptures suggest so, particularly those which depict Mars wearing a warrior's attire but holding a Cornucopia filled with fruits from the harvest. Some view Mars as a protector of the people and equate him with the god Teutates, who is referred to as the "ruler of the people" in several sites. Others propose that the Celtic Mars was a god of the wildwood or of healing, the latter originating from an image of a warrior battling against disease. Numerous inscriptions and altars to Mars are found throughout Celtic lands, indicating his popularity as a divinity or that the Roman god subsumed various divinities. Typical depictions of Mars portray him in Celtic military garb, sometimes even wearing a twisted-metal Torc around his neck, an interesting decision since Celtic warriors were defeated by the occupying Romans. Mars is occasionally depicted naked, armed with a weapon, a direct reference to the Celtic tradition of warriors going to battle without clothing or armor. Occasionally, Mars was depicted as three gods in Celtic mythology, a concept not present in Roman tradition. The Celts frequently utilized this allegorical technique to emphasize the divine power of Mars, found predominantly in Britain and among the Belgai and the Remi on the Continent. In some circumstances, the Mars figure was accompanied by a surname which is believed to come from the Celtic term for the district or tribal deity. Some of these Mars figures include names such as Mars Alator, Mars Albiorix (meaning “world-king,” who was the tribal god of the Albici of Gaul), Mars Beatucadrus (interpreted as “bright one” or “comely in slaughter”), Mars Braciaca (possibly a god of grain or ale), Mars Camulos (illustrated with an oak crown or with ram’s horns), Mars Caturix (meaning “battle-king”), Mars Lenus (a healing spring god of Trier in Germany), Mars Lucetius (meaning “light”), Mars Mediocius (found only in Colchester, England), Mars Mogetius (whose name appears on two inscriptions from Bourges and Seggau), Mars Mullo (meaning “mule” or “wall,” a healer shown with a horned serpent), Mars Nabelcus (known from several inscriptions in France), Mars Rigisamus (meaning “king of kings”), Mars Smertrius (whose name includes the same syllable for abundance as found in the goddess Rosmetra), and Mars Vesontius.
