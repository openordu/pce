Irish mythology has a historical site called Mag Tuired (also called Moyturra, Mag Tuirid, Magh Tuireadh, and Moytirra). Two significant battles took place on this plain, both of which ended in triumph for the Tuatha Dé Danann, the goddess Danu's people. These battles were fought against other groups for control over Ireland. During the first battle of Mag Tuired, the Tuatha Dé Danann warriors, led by their king, Nuada, took dominion of Ireland from the Fir Bolg, the previous residents. The second battle, considered to be more popular, saw the tribe of Danu eliminate the Fomorians. The exact location of Mag Tuired is under dispute, despite a general agreement that it was situated in Connacht's western region. Some people have proposed sites in Co. Mayo and Co. Sligo, where megalithic remains are scattered about the area, leading to the name "plain of the pillars."
