The Celts held a strong reverence for the moon, not unlike other societies. Its changing phases and connection to the tides were of natural importance. The Celts divided the year according to moons, with the new moon marking the beginning of each month. Moonrise was celebrated and festivals were held, such as May Eve before Beltane and Hallowe’en before Samhain. Scholars believe that the moon was especially significant to agriculturalists, as its waxing and waning cycle was thought to impact plant growth in a similar way to the tides. The Celts harvested Mistletoe under a waning moon, as the declining light indicated that it was time for endings. Conversely, sowing was always done under a waxing moon, as it was believed that the tiny plants within the seeds would also swell with the moon's growth. Evidence of ancient lunar rituals has been found, where night-long dancing occurred among the Celts during full moons. In the Scottish Highlands, such dances continued through the 18th century at Stone Circles. Even in the 19th century, people still bowed and showed respect to the new moon in the insular Celtic lands, while in Cornwall, a nod and a touch of money for good luck sufficed. In Ireland, individuals used to gather at crossroads to dance in the pearly light of a full moon; however, this tradition was nearly abolished due to the opposition of priests. Nonetheless, it has recently been revived in rural areas such as Ennis, County Clare.
