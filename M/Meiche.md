Meiche, also called Mechi or Merca, was a renowned Irish hero. As the only son of Mórrígan, the prominent war goddess, Meiche possessed an unusual trait of having three hearts. Curled inside each of these three hearts were three Serpents that, if permitted to develop fully, would emerge from his body and bring destruction to the land. Fortunately, Mac Cécht, a warrior hailing from the Tuatha Dé Danann clan, intervened and put an end to the impending catastrophe by slaying Meiche. The fragmented and charred remains of Meiche's body were subsequently disposed of in the Barrow River.
