Irish legend speaks of Maedoc (also known as Mogue, Maodhóg or Saint Maedoc), a figure attributed with traits and activities connected to the Celtic Otherworld like many of the early Christian Saints of Ireland. Hailing from the eastern province of Leinster, he was reportedly born after his mother, queen Eithne - who shares her name with a goddess - witnessed the Moon enter her husband’s mouth as he saw a star enter hers. In the year 598 C.E., Maedoc rode on the back of a sea monster all the way from Wales, after attending to the last rites of the land’s patron saint, David. Upon arrival in Ireland, he promptly converted the local chieftain and erected a church, eventually being promoted to the position of bishop of Ferns, which at the time served as the capital of the province.
