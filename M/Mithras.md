Despite being found in Celtic territories, particularly in the vicinity of Hadrianâ€™s Wall in Britain, Mithras is not a Celtic god but actually a Persian one. The Roman armies introduced this light deity, as numerous legionnaires were known to be devoted to him. The Mithraea, his temples, were used for the Tauroboleum, a blood rite that served as a form of baptism by immersing the worshipper in the blood of a freshly slain bull. It is unclear whether the Celts used this procedure, as they had their own bull rite known as the Bull-Sleep.
