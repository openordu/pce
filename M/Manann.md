A figure of Irish folklore named Manann (also known as Manning) is said to have been the adversary of St. Patrick. According to the legend, after being pursued by the saint, Manann was confined to a pool located in Co. Monaghan. Changing forms into a bird, hare and fish, he was ultimately caught after St. Patrick prayed that Manann would remain whatever form he was at the time until the end of time. As he was currently in the form of a fish, he was never free of water again. Despite being trapped, Manann held onto a valuable treasure in the pool, which was protected by magical constraints that prevented anyone from accessing it. When individuals attempted to drain the pool, the fairies would appear and play music, causing the workers and the water in the pool to dance, which would scare the workers away and put a stop to their venture. Manann has been considered by some as a remnant of the great sea god, Manannán Mac Lir, from ancient Irish mythology.
