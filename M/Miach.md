Son of the physician god Dian Cécht and a brother of the herbalist Airmid, Miach was a brilliant doctor and magician in the Irish mythology. He had healed king Nuada, who had lost his throne after being wounded in the great second battle of Mag Tuired, by making skin grow around his silver hand. Since only Miach’s magic could remove the taboo against a Blemished King, it restored Nuada as the king. However, Miach's success brought him no glory; instead, his envious father killed him as Dian Cécht could not tolerate his son's achievements which he himself could not make. Despite his death, Miach’s healing powers persisted, and the most powerful herbs in the world grew on his grave. Airmid cared for them and classified them according to the benefits they could bring to humanity. Unfortunately, Dian Cécht intervened again, and he scrambled the categories, causing the loss of the healing knowledge to humankind. St. Michael, see Michael.
