Irish mythology recounts the tale of Mal, a goddess, who chased after a man she desired across the Irish countryside until her death. This scenic beauty in the far west of Ireland, known as Ceann na Caillghe or “the head of the Hag” in Irish, is considered the legendary site of her passing. The town of Miltown Malbay located nearby is even named after her.
