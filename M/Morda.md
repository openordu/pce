Welsh mythology features a character named Morda, who is considered a hero. Morda, an elderly man, was responsible for tending to the fire below Ceridwen's grand Cauldron. During the course of events, Gwion tasted the enchanted brew in secret and obtained the Wisdom, which the blind attendant failed to notice. Incensed by this, Ceridwen struck Gwion with such force that he lost an Eye.
