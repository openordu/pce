Magog, a notable figure in Irish and British folklore identified as the ancestor of Partholón and Nemed, two initial invaders according to the Book Of Invasions, also appears in Cornish mythology as a famous giant. Along with being the forefather of the Scythians, believed to be ancient kin of the Irish, it remains uncertain if the Irish Magog and the Cornish Gog share any relation.
