An Irish hero named Morann is described in various medieval texts as a knowledgeable Brehon, or judge, who wore a chain around his neck. This chain had the peculiar quality of tightening around his neck should he speak false or unjust words, eventually leading to his strangulation. According to the same sources, if Morann placed this chain around the necks of those accused of false statements, the chain would act in the same way, ultimately leading to their punishment by strangulation.
