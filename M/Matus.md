A divinity of the British, Matus (Matunus) was venerated at Risingham, located to the north of the great wall constructed by emperor Hadrian in order to guard Britain from the belligerent tribes of the north. Although uncertainty exists about the gender of the entity, it is believed that Matus might have been a deity, and not gender specific. There exists a possibility that Matus was not a divinity of the Celtic but the Pictish people.
