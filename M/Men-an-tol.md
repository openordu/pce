A megalithic monument in Cornwall, near the village of Lanyon, is known as Men-an-tol, a site of Cornish mythology. It is famous for its ability to cure childhood ailments and spinal deformities. The monument is a large, round boulder with a hole in its center where a ritual is performed by pulling the afflicted through the stone while naked, and then rolling on the grass three times or three times three. In addition to its healing properties, Men-an-tol can also be used for divination. Placing two brass pins on the rock and asking a question will yield an answer as the pins dance. This site is also included in the category of Healing Stones.
