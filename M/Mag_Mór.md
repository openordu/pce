Irish mythology has a location known as Mag Mór (also spelled Mag Mor or Magh Mhór). The site was believed to be a vast plain in the Otherworld, where the deceased would wander unceasingly across the flat surface. It was considered to be a dimension that runs parallel to ours, with easy access between the two worlds. It is said that this belief persisted in Ireland up to 70 years ago, as evident from folklore.
