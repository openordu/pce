In the Scottish folklore, there exists the figure of Mala Liath. This name was attributed to a Cailleach or Hag figure who looked after a group of untamed pigs in Ross and Cromarty, Scotland. As a goddess of wild animals, especially deer, the Cailleach often appears in this form, but in other areas, she is more commonly known as a weather or creator deity. The term cailleach, signifying an elderly woman, has been absorbed into several languages, yet it is not of Celtic origin, which leads to the speculation that perhaps she descends from a pre-Celtic divine being.
