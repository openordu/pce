The festival of Midsummer, or Midsummer eve, was celebrated by the Celtic people as a calendar festival. In contrast to marking the Solstices and Equinoxes like other cultures, the Celts marked the days in the heart of each season, such as Imbolc, Beltane, Lughnasa, and Samhain. As the Celts encountered earlier civilizations that celebrated solar pivot-points as calendar feasts, they integrated those rituals into their own traditions. Due to the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, some of the original dates of old Celtic holidays became displaced, leading some harvest rituals of Lughnasa to move toward the end of June and become midsummer festivals. The Midsummer festival does not technically take place in the middle of summer but instead marks the beginning of the season on June 21, when the Sun is closest to the northern hemisphere for the entirety of the year and the day is longer than the night. In certain Celtic lands, such as Ireland and Scotland, daylight may last well into the evening hours during the summer solstice, leaving as little as five or six hours of darkness, leading to the common practice of feasting and dancing when the time arrived. In England, young girls went to Stone Circles to whisper the names of their preferred young men to the stones, which supposedly foretold the future on this day. People collected the seeds of ferns to create invisibility potions, and hemp was sowed to interpret omens on this day. Cornish girls had a peculiar way of discovering who they would marry. At the stroke of midnight, they'd leave their undergarments turned inside out and wait for a spectral figure to turn them right-side-out, thereby revealing their future spouse's identity. Another method was to gather a rose, place it in a bag, and preserve it until Christmas. The faded flower would attract the intended groom if worn to church.
