In the great romance of Tristan and Iseult, King Mark of Cornwall is one of the central figures involved in a love triangle with the eponymous couple. Upon receiving a single strand of dazzling gold hair, Mark determines that the woman to whom it belongs must be the most beautiful in the world and vows to marry her. This woman is revealed to be the Irish princess Iseult, and Mark sends his nephew Tristan to bring her back to his court. During their journey back, however, the pair accidentally ingests a potent magical liqueur that binds them in a love so strong that they can never be happy apart. Tristan dutifully delivers Iseult to her new husband, but she cannot bring herself to consummate the marriage and instead sends her handmaiden, Brangien, in her place. The lovers eventually leave the court for several years but return, whereupon Mark takes Iseult back without protest. In the story, Mark is a relatively small and passive character in comparison to the active lovers, who are reminiscent of other Celtic heroes whose wives left them for younger men. This recurring theme calls to mind the motif of a goddess of the land's sovereignty choosing a more virile and younger ruler as an older one fades away.
