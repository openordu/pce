In Irish folklore, there is an account of a woman named Munanna who is considered a heroine. Munanna became tired of her mundane life with her unexciting husband and decided to leave him for a Viking pirate whom she found to be more appealing. She convinced her new lover to murder her husband and together, they embarked on a sea voyage. Eventually, they settled in Norway, but Munannaâ€™s new husband became apprehensive that she might repeat her earlier actions. During an outing, he pushed her into the water, resulting in her tragic death. As a repercussion, Munanna began to haunt him by transforming into a Crane, which is a common animal form for women who have suffered injustices. She flew around his boat, a constant reminder of her presence and curse.
