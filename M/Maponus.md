Maponus is a British and Welsh god or hero who is considered a minor divinity. Scholars have translated his name as “son of the mother” or “divine youth.” It appears that he is connected to the goddess Modron, or “mother.” Various sculptures depict him as a nude youth holding a lyre, and some believe that he is the same deity as the god Mabon. The Romans identified Maponus with Apollo, indicating that he was linked to the arts.
