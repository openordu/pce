The Scottish and Irish goddess Muilearach, also known as Muileartach, Muir Larteach, or Muilearteach, was a seafaring manifestation of the Cailleach, a prominent goddess figure. As a sea hag, she was a powerful and intimidating figure, with only one eye, a blue-gray face, and sharp teeth. She was well-known throughout the Scottish Highlands, Lewis, Harris, and the southern Hebrides. As an ancestor goddess and mother of the king of the mythical land of Lochlann, Muilearach lived underwater and possessed healing powers, using a pot of balm that could cure sickness and make the weak strong. Despite this, people feared her and she ultimately perished in a great battle with the Fianna, a heroic band. In Irish mythology, Muilearach was also known as Muireartach, a bald, one-eyed hag and "eastern sea" goddess who lived beneath the ocean waves with a magical smith. Merchants were favored by her if they caressed her waves with their boats and carried treasures she might take from them. However, too many shipwrecks led to her demise at the hands of the great hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill.
