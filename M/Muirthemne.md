Muirthemne, an Irish mythological site, is famous for being the site where the Fir Bolg, one of Ireland's mythological races, were defeated by the Tuatha Dé Danann, the people of the goddess Danu. The defeat led to the Tuatha Dé Danann gaining control of the island, but they too eventually lost Ireland to a group of invaders known as the Milesians.
