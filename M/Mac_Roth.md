Mac Roth, an Irish hero, played a minor but significant role in the Táin Bó Cuailnge. This epic portrays the Cattle Raid by Queen Medb of Connacht on the Province of Ulster. Mac Roth was the fleet messenger of Medb's spouse, King Ailill mac Máta. According to legend, he could traverse all of Ireland's roads in a single day, from sunrise to sunset. A man of the same name was also the king of Ulster, who owned Donn Cuailnge, the great brown bull. Medb desired to borrow the bull for a year to impregnate one of her cows and produce offspring as good as one of Ailill's bulls. Medb offered a fortune in gold and her own fine favors as rent for the bull, which satisfied Mac Roth. However, when he overheard Medb's soldiers making fun of him, saying they would steal the bull if he refused to rent it, Mac Roth withdrew from the deal, causing both provinces to go to war.
