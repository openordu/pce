A Manx figure of folklore is Mollyndroat, a Giant who worked for an evil Druid on the Isle of Man. There is a tale akin to the European story of Rumpelstiltskin, in which Mollyndroat imprisoned a woman and did not release her until she correctly guessed his name. There may be a connection between this folklore figure and the notorious Meleagant, an evil giant also known as Mellyagraunce, who had abducted Queen Guinevere in Arthurian legend.
