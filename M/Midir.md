Midir was an Irish fairy king or god who once fell in love with the beautiful Étain in one of the most romantic tales of ancient Ireland. Regrettably, Midir was already married to the jealous Druid Fuamnach at the time, who cast a spell on Étain, causing her to transform into a fly. Despite being a beautiful fly, she remained a fly and eventually met her end by accidentally drowning in a glass of wine. Quite unexpectedly, a princess drank the wine and found herself pregnant, with the child being the reborn Étain, who grew up to be as beautiful as she was in her previous life but without any memory of her earlier life as Midir’s beloved. Eventually, she married the king of Tara, Eochaid Airem. Nevertheless, Midir did not forget her and set out to win her back. He arrived at Tara and challenged Eochaid to a game of Fidchell, with the reward being a single kiss from Étain, which he won. As they kissed, Étain's memory returned, and she recalled her life as Midir’s beloved. Both of them flew away through the skylight at Tara, joined by a golden chain. In addition to this romantic story, Midir is also mentioned in the tale of the movement of his people, the Tuatha Dé Danann, from the surface of Ireland to a parallel world underground. According to this account, the father of the gods, the Dagda, chose to step down from his position as leader of the tribe, allowing his son, Bodb Derg, to take his place. "The proud" Midir was the only god who opposed the others and waged a war. Although he did not achieve victory, the resulting bloodshed forced the other gods to retreat and seek refuge in their fairy dwellings or Sídhes. Midir settled in his own Sídhe, located in Brí Léith, also known as Slieve Callory or Ardagh Hill in western Co. Longford. Amongst local folklore, he is remembered as Midas, a giant who kidnaps children that unwittingly pass by his concealed palace.
