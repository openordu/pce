Myrddin, also known as the Welsh hero Myrdinn Wyllt, is often associated with the legendary magician Merlin. Geoffrey of Monmouth, a British historian, wrote of a king called "Wild Merlin" who, like the Irish king Suibhne, went insane and sought refuge in the forest, where he lived in a Bird costume or possibly transformed himself into a bird. It is believed that this king was based on the Welsh figure of Myrddin.
