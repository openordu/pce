An Irish goddess by the name of Mess Buachalla (Mes Buachalla) was involved in a story with the Fairy Queen or goddess Étain and her fated lover, the fairy king Midir. After eloping with Midir, Étain gave birth to a daughter, having been previously married to human husband Eochaid Airem. Eochaid Airem pursued the pair and caught up with them at Midir’s stronghold of Brí Léith. He demanded Étain back, but Midir used a fairy trick and sent out 50 identical women, one of whom was Étain while the rest were under a spell to look like her. Despite true love being able to see through fairy glamours, Eochaid was more interested in having a queen to ensure his reign at Tara than in Étain herself, and thus was unable to identify his wife. He selected one of the women and took her back to Tara, where she was crowned queen and reigned, looking identical to the missing queen. However, this woman was, in fact, Eochaid's own daughter who later went insane at the realization of their incestuous relationship, eventually gaining the name of Mess Buachalla which means "the herdswoman" or "the cow herd’s fosterling." An alternative version of the story suggests she was the daughter of Étain and Cormac, king of Ulster, who was ordered to be killed because Cormac wanted a male heir, but the warriors tasked with carrying out the order left her with the herdsman of the high king, Eterscél, who gave her the name Mess Buachalla. A woman of remarkable beauty became the wife of the high king after mating with a bird god named Nemglan. She gave birth to the king Conaire as a result of this encounter.
