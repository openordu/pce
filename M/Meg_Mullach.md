Meg Mullach, also known as Maug Moulach or Maggie Moloch, is a notable folkloric figure from Scotland. As a Brownie, Meg was one of many who aided humans with their never-ending work. She took care of Tullochgorm castle, which was owned by the Grant family. Despite Meg's childlike appearance, she had an impressive head of hair, which led to her being nicknamed Hairy Meg. In certain versions of her story, it is said that she also had hairy hands and would sometimes reach down chimneys to steal children. One memorable incident involved her helping a stingy farmer who had dismissed all his farmhands when he realized that Meg would do everything for free. However, Meg requested her wages too, which was forbidden as per the tradition of Laying The Fairies. So, when she disappeared after receiving her payment, she was merely exercising her rights as a Brownie.
