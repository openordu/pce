A concept related to the universe - magic. It is defined as spoken or action-based activities that are intended to bring about a change in the external world. Magic is typically an individual pursuit, unlike religion where group rituals and chanting are common. Though, with the Celtic Druids, the distinction between individual and communal endeavors is somewhat blurry. Individual action could be taken for the greater good of the community. For instance, a Satire might depose an ungenerous king, but the social duty of the Bard is to ensure that wealth is fairly and justly distributed through the king, and the Satire serves as a corrective measure that ensures social harmony. Celts, like all other ancient communities, practiced magic for both propitiatory and intercessory purposes to ward off evil and draw good things near. Amulets were used from the earliest times, and these have been uncovered in early Celtic archaeological sites like La TÈNE and Hallstatt. There is much evidence in mythological texts that curses were spoken as verbal magic. Some of the Celtic magical practices still remain as superstitions in the present day. For instance, shortened versions of personal names are still used as nicknames, although this is no longer to keep loved ones hidden from the Otherworld's eyes to protect them from the threat of Fairy kidnappings. Leaving behind small rags at sacred Wells or tied to Trees is a ritual that has survived to this day. The rags referred to as Clooties serve as left-behind prayers or purgative rituals that collect negative influences to discarding them. Numerous Celtic divinities possessed magical abilities, particularly those linked to druids or bards. Among the Welsh, there was the magician-bard Gwydion who, with the assistance of Math, his uncle, transformed flowers into an enlivened bride for his foster son Lleu Llaw Gyffes. Meanwhile, in stories originating from Welsh sources within Arthurian legend, there was the remarkable magician Merlin who could Shape-Shift. Ireland also had several deities that were capable of changing their shapes; the sea god, Manannán Mac Lir, was the most prominent.
