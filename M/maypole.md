Folklore enthusiasts have long appreciated the maypole as an important custom and object. Typically, a sturdy, vertical tree trunk is felled and repositioned near Beltane festivals, symbolizing the flourishing of life in natural settings come the springtime. Morris Dancing groups would adorn it with vivid ribbons and engage in intricate, choreographed dance performances beneath the canopy of ribbons. Scholars have observed that the maypole resembles a corrupted iteration of the universal and age-old Tree of Life.
