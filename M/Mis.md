The Dindshenchas tells a tale of an Irish heroine named Mis who was given the towering mountain range of Slieve Mish in County Kerry as a bride-price. Mis was the daughter of a warrior who discovered her father’s bloodied body after a battle. Overcome with sorrow, Mis drank his blood, which drove her mad. She retreated into the mountains and survived by killing animals with her hands until she heard a harper named Dubh Rois sing. Mis spoke for the first time since her descent into madness to ask about his musical instrument, which she remembered from her father’s house, and then his sexual instrument, which she did not. With kindness, he showed her both. After making love to Dubh Rois, Mis lost her wildness and began to love him. She went on to become a bard after Dubh Rois was killed in battle, and did not return to madness. Scholars have noted the similarities between this tale and the Irish story of a goddess of Sovereignty who appears as a Hag until kissed, as well as the Sumerian myth of the taming of the wild man Enkidu by the temple woman Siduri.
