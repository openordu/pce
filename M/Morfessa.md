Irish hero Morfessa was a wise master of one of the four magnificent capitals of the Tuatha Dé Danann, a magical race that came to Ireland from another land. These four capitals were each led by a master of wisdom instead of a king, with Falias being one of them. From Falias came the great Inauguration Stone known as the Lia Fáil. It was Morfessa who granted the Tuatha Dé the stone when they sailed for Ireland.
