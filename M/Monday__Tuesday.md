A popular tale regarding the Fairies revolves around their limited musical repertoire despite enjoying dancing and singing. The common words they repeatedly sang were “Monday, Tuesday” (Da Luan, Da Mart in Irish). Once a hunchback was annoyed with their monotonous song and added “and Wednesday” (Agus da Cadin), which caused great excitement and joy among the Fairies. In gratitude for the new melody, the hunchback was gifted the ability to walk straight as an arrow as his hunch was removed by the Fairies. Another hunchback hearing the story rushed to the same spot and waited for the Fairies to arrive. As soon as they began singing, he rudely interrupted them by adding “and Friday” (Agus da Hena). The Fairies were furious with the impudent man and promptly gave him the first hunchback's hump in addition to his own.
