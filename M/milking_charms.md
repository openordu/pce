Folklore held that milking charms were necessary to protect the milk supply in Celtic lands where cattle were relied upon for a considerable amount of food. Superstitions and rituals were concocted to ensure that nobody could steal the milk. These included splattering a few drops of milk on the ground, crossing a sign over the udder of the cow, and speaking charms and prayers. Stepping in spilled milk or crossing in front of a cow that had kicked over a milking pail was forbidden. On Beltane, the start of the summer on May 1, milking charms were especially necessary in Ireland, as fairies and witches would try to steal all the milk from the cows. Twigs of Rowan would be tied to the cowsâ€™ tails; a Mary Candle would be melted and the wax rubbed into the cows' hides. Milking charms were linked to Lughnasa, the harvest festival on August 1, in Scotland: Juniper would be burned before the barn, or stale urine sprinkled on its door, and balls of hair would be put into the milk pail to keep the milk from being bewitched away. Another powerful charm involved boiling cow dung into a paste and adding several straight metal pins; any witch attempting to steal milk would suffer stabbing pains until she arrived at the farmhouse door with pleas for mercy. Placing urine in a bottle and sealing it could prevent a witch from being able to use their kidneys to steal. Additionally, an herb called pearlwort placed on a Bull before conception was believed to ensure a cow's continued milk production and protect any resulting heifers.
