Muime is a figure from Scottish folklore whose name translates to "stepmother" or "foster mother," or "wet nurse." Throughout Scottish lore, she remains an uncertain character, embodying both good and bad luck. If encountered while far from home, she is considered an ill omen, but she presents herself as a helpful sprite when in close proximity. It is thought that this figure represents a relic of Celtic times when foster mothers played an influential role.
