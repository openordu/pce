Irish hero Morholt, also known as Morhold, was a formidable warrior and giant who imposed a yearly tribute on the land of Cornwall's king, Mark. After a fierce battle, Morholt was slain by the valiant knight Tristan, who barely survived the encounter with the Irishman's poisonous sword. Eventually, Tristan fell deeply in love with Morholt's beautiful niece, the fair Iseult.
