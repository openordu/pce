A god in Welsh mythology was Manawydan (also known as Manawyddan and Manawydan fab Llˆyr). While his name suggests he could be related to the Irish sea god Manannán Mac Lir, the Welsh associated him more with famine than with sailing. Despite this, Manawydan was still connected to the Otherworld. To the Welsh, the Otherworld was typically below ground rather than out to sea, as opposed to the Irish viewpoint. Numerous branches of the Mabinogion, a significant collection of Welsh mythological stories from the Middle Ages, include Manawydan. In the second branch, he accompanied his brother, the gigantic hero Brân The Blessed, to Ireland to save their sister Branwen from an abusive marriage to king Matholwch. Upon arrival, the king set many traps for the rescuers, but they fought so fiercely that only a few Irishmen survived. This rendered Ireland empty except for five pregnant women. Manawydan accompanied the miraculous Head of his brother Brân back to Wales and provided safe passage for Branwen, who died of sorrow upon her return. Later, Manawydan became the second husband of the miraculous queen (and likely goddess) Rhiannon, in a dual wedding where her son Pryderi and his beloved Cigfa also got married. Soon after, the land became barren, and all people and animals vanished into an Otherworldly mist. Manawydan tried to survive by hunting, but eventually, he took the group to the east, where they became artisans. Manawydan was exceptionally skilled in shoemaking, and this eventually led to other craftsmen fearing that they would lose business. The artisans were then chased away. In Wales, Rhiannon and Pryderi vanished after being cursed, causing further hardship. Manawydan lived with Cigfa and tried to earn a living at the market but was forced to leave because of his prowess. He then turned to agriculture but was faced with crop destruction. Upon discovering mice were responsible, he prepared to execute them when he was approached by travelers who wanted to save the rodents as they were actually friends of an old adversary of Pryderi's father in disguise. Manawydan made a deal and reunited his family with the other couple, and from that point on they enjoyed a happy and tranquil life.
