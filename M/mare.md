The mythological animal known as the mare held special significance to the Celts, particularly the female horse. Epona, the horse goddess of the continent, was typically depicted riding a mare or surrounded by fillies. Macha, the Irish goddess, engaged in horse racing while pregnant, as though she were a mare herself. Similarly, Rhiannon, the Welsh goddess, traveled on a magical mare. At Uisenach, the main sacred hill in Ireland, tunnels in the shape of a stallion pursuing a mare were discovered beneath a rampart and ditch, leading to its interpretation as a horse temple. Folklore and superstition eventually replaced myth, and the belief in the "true mare," the seventh consecutive filly of a mare, arose after Christianization. This fortunate being could not be abducted by the Fairies and possessed the ability to safeguard its owners from Fairy Kidnapping. Where a true mare was born, Shamrocks blossomed to honor the animal.
