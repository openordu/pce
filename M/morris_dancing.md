Pleated white shirts, white trousers, ribboned caps, and bells – these are the signature elements of morris dancing, a British ritual that added a unique flair to springtime festivals in rural parts of the country. A fiddler typically played while the dancers energetically moved about, led by a performer who carried a sword with a Cake impaled on it. The dance had its origins in a springtime ritual that symbolized renewal, with the phallic connotations of the sword emphasizing those of the Maypole around which the dance troupe often performed. This festival, known as Beltane, frequently culminated in wild behavior that matched the season's burgeoning energy.

The idea of the mother goddess is a fundamental concept in Celtic mythology. Although not all Celtic goddesses shared a maternal nature—some represented war, power, and land—Celtic culture clearly held motherhood in high esteem. In particular, goddesses associated with maternity were venerated and celebrated, with names such as Deae Matres, which means “the mothers,” and Modron, which means “mother.” Evidence of mother goddesses dates back to the neolithic period in Gaul (ca. 4000 B.C.E.), which predates the arrival of the Celts by over a thousand years. It is likely that the Celts either brought their own maternal divinities or adopted those of the indigenous people. Due to the lack of written documents from pre-Roman Celtic lands, it is unclear how the Celtic mother-goddess figures came about, but it is clear that they were firmly established by the time the Roman legions arrived in 400 B.C.E. The divine mother was a notable figure in the eyes of the Celts. In fact, the most frequently carved votive image in their religion was that of a mother, or a group of mothers. Many of these carvings were small and appear to have been used for decorating household altars rather than public ones, although some were large and played a role in public ceremonies. Some even seem to have been carried through processions, similar to how the image of the Virgin Mary was later carried by Catholics on May 1st during the feast of the “Queen of the May." Interestingly enough, the celebration of the “Queen of the May” initially derived from the Celtic festival of Beltane. Despite this, there were fierce opponents of paganism, such as St. Martin of Tours, who called for the wholesale destruction of Celtic “idols,” including hundreds of feminine divine images, some of which were incontrovertibly destroyed by himself personally.
