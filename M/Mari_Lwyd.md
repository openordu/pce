A Welsh folkloric figure known as Mari Lwyd (Mari Llud) was celebrated in villages throughout South Wales during the period between Christmas and January 6, the old New Year’s Day. Known as the Hobbyhorse tradition, it involved a group carrying the decorated head of a horse, believed to be the Mare Mari Lwyd, while going from house to house. The group demanded entry using obscure words, which were answered with verses from within. Finally, the horse and her carriers were welcomed in and celebrations followed. This tradition of “trick-or-treating” may have descended from earlier safety or propitiatory rituals, making the Mari Lwyd a probabble ritual of safety and appeasing cosmic powers for the new year. The modern Welsh poet Dylan Thomas was familiar with this folklore, finding inspiration for his “Ballad of the Mari Lwyd.”
