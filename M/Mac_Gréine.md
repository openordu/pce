Mac Gréine was an Irish god who, along with his brothers Mac Cécht and Mac Cuill, formed a triad of gods whose wives were goddesses of the land. He was also the husband of Ériu, the earth goddess after whom Ireland is named. Although his name translates to "son of the Sun," which some have taken as evidence of an ancient Irish solar god, it could also be a matrilineal name or title since the Irish word for sun is feminine. In any case, it is clear that Mac Gréine's father was not the Sun, but rather Ogma, the god of eloquence, like his brothers. Sadly, Mac Gréine lost his life to the warrior poet Amairgin of the Milesians.
