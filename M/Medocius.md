A god named Medocius from Britain is only mentioned in one inscription in Colchester. Medocius might have been a local deity, specifically a Genius Loci affiliated with the land. There is a possibility that the god had a warrior aspect and could have been a defender of territory due to his association with the Roman god Mars.
