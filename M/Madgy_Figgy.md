Near Raftra, there lived a famous Witch of Cornwall named Madgy Figgy (or Madge Figgy), who was known as a Cornish heroine. She gained her livelihood by scavenging wreckage from ships. Some people believed that she had the power to conjure storms through magic. She allegedly sat on a massive basalt rock located off the coast of Land's End, which had a level surface on its top, where she could summon the spirits of the weather. Madgy Figgy and her group of wreckers once discovered the body of a Portuguese woman who had drowned in one of the storms that the witch had caused. Madgy Figgy claimed the jewels that the woman was wearing and concealed them in a chest in her house. Every night a strange light was seen traveling to Madgy's cottage, which eventually led to the chest. A stranger, who had followed the same path as the light, left the town with all the woman's jewels, while Madgy had made a fortune through the ransom. "One witch knows another, living or dead," she stated with wisdom.
