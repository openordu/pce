Territory of Ireland known as Bréifne (Breffni) owes its name to a seldomly mentioned figure in Irish mythology, the goddess or heroine Bréifne. It is believed that she may have been the deity representing the region's sovereignty. The Dindshenchas, which is a collection of place poetry in Ireland, tells of Bréifne as a courageous Warrior Woman who perished while defending her people and their land against malevolent encroachers.
