The Black Chanter is an intriguing part of Scottish mythology, which refers to an enchanted musical instrument that belonged to the Chisholms of Strath Glas. It was a part of a bagpipe and there are many tales that have been told about it in Scotland. According to legend, a foreign magician gifted the Black Chanter to the leader of Chisholms. It had certain magical properties - if played by a Cameron, the traditional pipers of the region, it permitted one to travel through the air. The instrument also served as a kind of Banshee, foretelling death by cracking the evening before a death in the family. It's said that a silver ring was placed around the chanter each time this occurred to repair it, until eventually, the entire instrument was covered with silver rings.
