Household sprite of Wales, the bucca (also known as bwca, bucca-boo, pwca, bwci, coblyn, bwbach, bwciod) is a Welsh mythological being similar to a Brownie in that he would work for food. However, if a resident failed to leave out a bowl of milk or other treat, mischief was expected. It was also crucial not to inquire about the bucca's name, as this would cause it to leave the farm in displeasure. Some storytellers and folklorists differentiate between the helpful bucca gwidden and the malevolent bucca dhu, though the name is at times a general term for Fairy.
