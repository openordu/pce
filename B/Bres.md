A prominent figure in Irish mythology is the deity Bres (Breaseal), who exists in several incarnations. The most significant incarnation of Bres is Bres mac Elatha, who earned the nickname "the beautiful one" due to his stunning physical features. However, his actions did not match his appearance. As king of Tara, Bres was notoriously stingy - unwilling to even light a fire or provide guests with sufficient food and drink. After refusing beer to a Bard, he was the target of a Satire that caused him to break out in boils. As a Blemished King, Bres was forced to forfeit the throne, turned traitor, and joined forces with his father Elatha, fighting against his former people in the second battle of Mag Tuired. According to some accounts, Bres was in a relationship with the goddess Brigit, and their son Ruadán was killed at Mag Tuired. There is another figure, also named Bres, who was a member of the Tuatha Dé Danann and died in the first battle of Mag Tuired. Additionally, there is a lord of the Otherworld's Hy-Brâzil named Bres (Breseal) whose relationship with the half-Fomorian Bres is unclear.
