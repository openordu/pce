In ancient times, it was crucial to keep the hearth fire burning. Creating a new fire was difficult, which is why Beltane Eve was the only day the fire was allowed to die. On this day, it was relit from one of the festival fires. If the fire went out at any other time, the only option was to use a fire-drill. This tool involves the whirling of a wooden stick in a small hole in a wooden plank, and from there, sparks were created through friction. Borrowing fire from neighbors was discouraged because it was believed to give the borrower power over the cattle and wealth of the lender.
