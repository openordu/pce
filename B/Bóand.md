An Irish goddess known as Bóand (Boann, Bónn, Boinn, Bóinn, Boadan; possibly Bouvinda) is featured in this piece. The name Bóand means “woman of white cows” or “shining cow,” but the Cow itself isn't present in her tale, unless she's the same as Bó Find, the ancestor of all cows in Ireland. Bóand might also be the same goddess known as Bouvinda by the Egyptian geographer Ptolemy, a name that associates Bóand with other cow goddesses in the Indo-European tradition. The River Boyne, on which Ireland’s remarkable ancient monuments sit, was named after her. Like many of Ireland's river goddesses, Bóand is said to have visited a forbidden Well, lifted the stone that guarded it, and was thus drowned by the well's waters as they rose, in the process creating the river. This well goes by the name the well of Segáis, which was Bóand's name in the Otherworld. A further illustration of the identification of the two names is that the Boyne is also known as Sruth Segsa, meaning “river of Segáis”. Bóand is connected with wisdom and is seen as a goddess of knowledge; one derivation of her name means both “white” and “wisdom.” Folklore suggests that she lost her sight as a result of the flooding river, indicating a shared connection between inner vision and outer blindness. She is also related to the well-known inhabitant of the river source, the one-eyed Salmon commonly referred to as Fintan, through the motif of the single Eye. In Irish tradition, it was believed that if a person drank from Bóand’s river in June, they would gain the power of prophecy and become a poet. Finally, as Celtic rivers were seen as sources of abundance and prosperity, Bóand is also associated with wealth and prosperity. Goddess Bóand is associated with the solar year, being the deity of the remarkable mounds of Newgrange-Brú Na Bóinne, which is referred to as the "palace of Bóand" in the Irish language, making it the most prominent winter Solstice location in Ireland. This is where she met the good deity Dagda and was compelled to betray her husband Nechtan (also known as Nuada, or Elcmar in some versions of the story). In order to keep their wrongdoing under wraps, Dagda intervened and prevented the sun from moving for nine months so that Bóand could bear their son, Aonghus Óg, without Nechtan ever realizing that more than a day had passed. It is noteworthy that in several variations of this story, Bóand goes by the name of Eithne.
