Irish ritual called buada (or buadha) subjected the king, in ancient Ireland, to a series of mystic regulations after his Inauguration. Some of these regulations were prohibitions, known as Geis, whereas others, called buada, were mandatory. Buada included eating certain foods and behaving in certain ways. For instance, the king at Tara was required to eat the meat of the Hares of Naas, a food that was considered taboo by others. Breaking these regulations would cause the land to stop bearing food, which would consequently result in the king's removal from his office. The topic of Kingship is also related to this practice.
