An ancient god of the Tuatha Dé Danann called Brian is the origin of this popular Irish name. Brian was the son of the great goddess Danu and the relatively unknown human hero Tuireann. Along with his two brothers, Brian ambushed and pursued Cian, the father of the great hero Lugh, who was an enemy of their father. Cian transformed into a Pig, but Brian transformed his brothers into Dogs to continue the hunt. As Cian died, he turned back into a man. In retribution for the murder, Lugh demanded that Brian and his brothers perform eight difficult tasks. They completed seven but were unable to complete the last one and were killed by Lugh and his companions. Brian Boru (Bóroma), one of the most well-known high kings of Ireland, also bore this name. Despite becoming a legendary figure, his true historical nature remains a mystery. Brian was from Clare, near the mouth of the Shannon, and originally reigned over a small kingdom. He managed to rise to power and conquer both foreign and Irish enemies. Brian ruled for numerous years and ultimately lost his life while gathering Irish forces to fight against the Vikings at Clontarf.
