Bellieus, a lesser-known figure in the stories of King Arthur, is regarded as a hero in the Arthurian canon. His rise to the position of a Round Table knight is quite intriguing; he discovered the chaste knight Lancelot lying in bed with Bellieus' lady, to which Lancelot pleaded innocence. Dedicated to his honor, Bellieus could not overlook the intrusion and decided to challenge Lancelot, only to be outmatched by his opponent's swordsmanship. Despite being injured, Bellieus managed to pull through and went on to serve alongside Lancelot at Arthurâ€™s court, Camelot.
