To the west lies the Mythic theme, an important concept in Celtic culture. It was considered unwise to make additions to your home on the western side, as it could be built on Fairy property. If constructed on "gentle land" where fairies dwelled, such places would cause endless trouble. A young person who disregarded the warnings of the older generation and constructed a cowshed in such a location found himself dealing with mysterious cattle deaths and being attacked with Fairy Darts while he slept. He eventually removed the roof of the structure to expose it to the elements, which resolved the issue.
