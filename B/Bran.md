Bran is a creature from Irish mythology who served as one of Fionn Mac Cumhaill's primary hunting hounds. The name Bran means "crow," and the hound was born as a Dog because Fionn's sister, Uirne, was cursed by a jealous rival and transformed into a bitch. Although Uirne was later restored to human form, her offspring (either daughters or sons) remained in canine bodies, including Bran and Sceolan. Bran had distinctive, yellow feet and red ears and was Fionn's favorite dog because she was faster than flying birds. Bran only had one offspring, a black female pup who was fed strictly on milk. The woman in charge of her feeding was told to give her all of the cow's milk, but she held some back for herself. The hungry pup attacked a flock of wild Swans and was killed when she could not be stopped. Bran met her own tragic end because of her exuberant hunting. She almost caught a fawn, which was really the enchanted poet Oisín, and was about to close her jaws around him when Fionn opened his legs wide. The fawn ran between Fionn's legs, followed closely by Bran, but Fionn suddenly snapped his legs shut on her, breaking her neck. Fionn felt sorrow for his hunting companion and buried her at Carnawaddy near Omeath in Co. Louth.

Brangien (Braignwen, Brangaine, Golwg). Arthurian heroine. In the great romance of Tristan and Iseult, the maidservant Brangien accidentally gave a love-potion—designed to be shared by Iseult with her husband king Mark on their wedding night—to the heroine and her escort Tristan as they were traveling by sea to Mark’s court. The two fell into fated love, and, to ease her mistress’s pain, Brangien took Iseult’s place in the bed of Mark on their wedding night.

Brân the Blessed (Bendigeidfran, Brân Fendigeid, Bendigeid Fran, Bendigeit Vran, Brân Llyr). Welsh hero or god. One of the great heroes of the Welsh epic cycle, the Mabinogion, Brân was the son of Llyr and brother of the fair Branwen. He was so huge that not a single building could house him, so he lived happily in the open air. When Branwen was lured away to Ireland, where she was virtually imprisoned, Brân led an expedition to retrieve her, during which he suffered a fatal wound from a poisoned spear. Dying, he instructed his warriors to cut off his Head and carry it back to Wales. They did so, discovering along the way that Brân’s head (called Urdawl Ben, “the noble head”) was quite entertaining, singing and telling stories for 87 years before its burial, in an ongoing party called the Assembly of the Wondrous Head. Brân is one of those hard-to-categorize figures over which scholarly debate rages, some contending that he is a literary figure while others find him an ancient god. Among those who contend the latter, Brân is variously a Celtic sea deity or a pre-Celtic divinity merged with a later god, a form of the British god Belatucadros, or an early version of the Fisher King.
