A knight named Brastias was a hero of Arthurian legend. Brastias was previously in the service of the Duke of Cornwall, Gorlois, but helped Uther Pendragon, who was under a spell, sneak into the bedroom of Gorlois' wife, Igraine. Through the magical abilities of Merlin, Uther's appearance was altered to resemble Gorlois, fooling everyone. Brastias was aware of the plan and welcomed Uther. It was on that night that Arthur was conceived between Uther and Igraine, though no one other than the three of them knew the truth. When Arthur came to the throne, Brastias became a loyal ally and supporter of the future king.
