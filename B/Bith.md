Offspring of Noah in the Bible, Bith is regarded as an Irish god or hero, and a father to Cesair, who settled in Ireland, fleeing the flood in her own ark. According to the Book of Invasions, Bith arrived in Munster with Cesair, and later moved with 17 of her 50 handmaidens to Ulster where he eventually died on Slieve Beagh. Bith's resting place is believed to be the Great Cairn, which no longer exists. It is noted that 'bith' in Irish translates to cosmos; it is possible that this enigmatic character held greater significance in the past, more than it appears in his fragmented myth.
