On the spring feast of Imbolc, Brigit was often referred to as Biddy, an Irish goddess, in Ireland. During this time, children would visit various homes, requesting donations. White-clad young men known as the "Biddy Boys" in Kerry would sing at each doorstep, chanting "Something for poor Biddy! Her clothes are torn. Her shoes are worn. Something for poor Biddy!" While this tradition diminished during the latter part of the 1900s, it has recently been restored, as Biddy boys and girls adorned in extravagant straw hats dance in Kerry towns, seeking donations on behalf of the poor.
