Belenus, also known as Bel or Belinus, was a god in the Continental Celtic pantheon. Some have suggested that he was the origin of the spring festival Beltane. Although little is known about Belenus, the Romans compared him to Apollo and he was worshipped at healing waters, such as Aquae Borvonis in France, and a plant called Belinuntia was named after him, indicating that he may have been associated with health. Belenus's worship was widespread, as evidenced by inscriptions found throughout Gaul and references in classical texts. His name means "bright" or "shining one," suggesting that he may have been a solar deity, often associated with healing springs. The ancient author Apollonius relates a Celtic story of a stream formed by the tears of Apollo Belenus when he was cast out of heaven by his father, reinforcing the theory that Belenus had solar connections. In Britain, Geoffrey of Monmouth mentions a hero named Belinus who was twin to Brennius and fought for the throne but ultimately agreed to share power. Despite sharing a name, it is unclear whether this figure had any connection to the continental Belinus, who was not described as warlike.
