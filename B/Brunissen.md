In Provence, France, there are tales of a Fairy Queen or goddess named Brunissen, which translates to “the brown one” or “the brown queen.” This Brunissen is believed to be a Continental Celtic heroine, reminiscent of the Celtic Bird goddesses Rhiannon. According to the stories, Brunissen was left orphaned in the magical forest of Brocéliande, where she wept incessantly for seven years. The only thing that could soothe her was the singing of magical birds. One day, a knight from the Round Table called Giflet (or Jaufré) stumbled upon the forest and fell into an enchanted sleep. Brunissen was drawn to him and distracted from her grief. Some scholars suggest that Brunissen may represent the dark aspect of an ancient Sun goddess, also known as the “black sun” of the Otherworld.
