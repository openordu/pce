Bronach, an Irish heroine or goddess, is associated with the line of cliffs marking the edge of the Co. Clare coast in the west of Ireland. The highest cliff, called Ceann na Cailighe or "hag's head," is named after the mythological figure of the Hag. Another nearby rocky place is known as the "hag of Black Head". While some researchers argue that the Cailleach of the region is not Bronach but Mal, the association with Bronach remains strong.
