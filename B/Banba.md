Irish goddess Banba (Banbha) was encountered by the first Irish Celts, the Milesians, along with two other goddesses or queens of the Tuatha Dé Danann who each announced themselves as rulers of the land. When the Milesians arrived in Co. Kerry, Banba first met them on Slieve Mis, though other sources suggest she was found on the plain from which the royal hill of Tara rises. She promised the Milesians happiness and wealth as long as the land bore her name. The next goddess, Fódla, on her mountain Slieve Felim in Co. Limerick, made the same promise in exchange for the same honor. However, the Milesians were finally greeted by the most impressive goddess, Ériu on the central hill of Uisneach, who claimed they would be guaranteed to live happily forever in her land if it bore her name. She was given precedence over the others. The three earth goddesses were associated with the continental Celtic triple goddess of fertility, known as the Deae Matres or “mother goddesses,” but could also have been three unrelated goddesses who were brought together by newcomers in a shared narrative. Though wisdom about Banba's individual mythological cycle has been discarded, her statement to the Milesians reveals that she was an ancient divinity who had been in Ireland before the biblical Noah, whose descendant Cesair was the first human to reach the land. In some versions of the Book of Invasions, it is said that Banba, one of Ireland's goddesses, was banished by the Milesians using Spells; this suggests the removal of an early divinity by invaders. It is unclear what Banba's original meaning was. Mac Cuill, "son of Hazel," was named as Banba's husband, along with two other gods or heroes who were married to the other two goddesses of Ireland. This suggests a possible connection with poetic inspiration, as hazel nuts were believed to feed the Salmon of wisdom. The Pig is associated with Banba and is sometimes considered her emblem, possibly because her name resembles the word for piglet, banb. Pigs were symbols of the goddess of the underworld in many European cultures dating back to 6000 B.C.E. and were considered to be connected with prosperity in Ireland. Even though Banba is associated in myth with several parts of Ireland, she is most closely linked with Malin Head, the most northerly point in Ulster, also known as Banba's Crown. Interestingly, Cesair, the earliest human arrival in Ireland, is sometimes referred to as Banba. The name Banba continues to be a poetic term used for Ireland.
