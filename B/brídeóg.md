A puppet claiming to represent St. Bridget, the Christian figure who adopted many qualities of the earlier Celtic goddess Brigit, is known as the brídeóg, a symbolic object. The body of the doll is fashioned by drawing together and binding the unplaited clusters of two long strands of green rushes that are intertwined to create a small square. A second cluster of rushes, bound near each end to form hands, is attached crosswise to the body. The puppet is then dressed in rags. Sometimes a broom or churn-dash is used instead of rushes, and a turnip is used for the head. In Ireland, until recently, children carried the effigy by going from house to house on the eve of Brigit's day, which is the ancient Celtic feast of Imbolc, asking for pennies "for poor Biddy." In some localities, only unmarried girls could bear the brídeóg, which translates to "little Brigit," while in others, both boys and girls were involved in the procession.
