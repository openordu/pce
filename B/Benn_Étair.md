Located near Dublin, Benn Étair (also known as Ben Edair or Ben Edar) is a legendary site featured in numerous Irish myths. The exhausted protagonists in the tale of the Sons of Tuireann believed that setting their sights on Benn Étair would restore their strength, suggesting that the hill possessed healing properties. Additionally, Aidín, the mourning widow of the hero Oscar, was interred at Benn Étair by the Bard Oisín. The hill is also believed to have been the abode of Étain of the Fair Hair, a fairy woman who died of heartbreak after her mortal spouse was slain. According to legends, the hill was named in honor of Étain’s father, Étar.
