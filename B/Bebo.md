An Irish heroine named Bebo, who was married to the Fairy king Iubdan and was equally small in stature, journeyed with her husband to the land of Ulster, where they perceived the inhabitants to be Giants. The charming and petite queen drew the attention of the king of Ulster, Fergus. Despite facing certain physical difficulties (as his phallus was larger than her entire body), Bebo became Fergus's paramour for a span of one year. Nevertheless, Fergus was obliged to surrender her back to Iubdan after he had offered a pair of enchanted shoes to Fergus in exchange for her.
