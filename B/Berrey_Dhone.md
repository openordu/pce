A deity worshipped by the Manx people was Berrey Dhone, also known as Brown Berry. This hag or witch resided in North Barrule Mountain, either inside or on top of the mountain, in the Isle of Man. She was an Amazonian giant, similar to other manifestations of the Cailleach. Her rocky heelprint on the mountainside still exists today.
