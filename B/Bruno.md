Arthurian hero Bruno, also known as Bruno le Noir and La Cote Male-Taile, exemplifies a rags-to-riches tale in the Arthurian canon. Bruno initially worked as a pot cleaner upon arriving in Camelot, but after tying the knot with Maledisant, he eventually ascended to the positions of landowner and knight.
