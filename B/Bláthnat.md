The Irish goddess known as Bláthnat, also referred to as Blanaid, Blathait, and Bláithíne, was believed to be the daughter of either Midir, the king of Irish Fairies, or Concobar Mac Nessa, the human king of Ulster. Her name means “little flower.” According to Irish legend, the hero Cúchulainn brought her from the Otherworld along with her magical Cattle and Cauldron. However, Cú Roí, who was also present during the raid, later stole everything, including Bláthnat. Cúchulainn suffered more as Cú Roí buried him in sand and shaved off his hair, causing others to humiliate him. Bláthnat was not happy with Cú Roí, and after a year, she conspired with Cúchulainn to assassinate Cú Roí, with whom she was living. She is the Irish version of the Welsh goddess Blodeuwedd, as she showed Cúchulainn the secret way to kill her husband. The story does not end with just one death because Cú Roí's poet, Ferchertne, pushed Bláthnat over a cliff, killing himself in the process. Bláthnat's enslavement by Cú Roí caused others to see her as deceitful and treacherous for planning his murder. In a Christian legend, she is said to have converted and entered a convent, thus avoiding being killed.
