Welsh hero Bedwyr (also known as Bedivere, Bedwyr fab Bedrawg) was highly respected in the mythological text Kulhwch And Olwen for his exceptional bravery and willingness to engage in fights, despite being less handsome than Arthur and certainly not Lancelot. Bedwyr's significance later waned in the Arthurian literature where he was only referred to as Arthur's butler. However, his initial importance lingered in the story as he was given the task of casting the noble sword Excalibur into the water, enabling the magical Lady Of The Lake to reclaim it. After accomplishing this, Bedwyr placed the dying king in the boat headed to Avalon.
