A goddess or heroine in Irish mythology, Bé Chuma (also spelled Bechuma, Bé Cuma, Bé cuma) was a member of the mystical race of the Tuatha Dé Danann, renowned for her insatiable desires. Hailing from the Otherworld, she abandoned her powerful husband for another man, which led to her banishment from her realm to ours. Her capriciousness continued on this earth, as she yearned for her stepson Art Mac Cuinn while being married to the king of Tara, Conn of the Hundred Battles. As the queen of Tara symbolized the authority over the land, Bé Chuma had the ability to replace a king with another. Rather than seizing the opportunity, she was sent away from Tara when Art came back with his wife and demanded Bé Chuma's banishment.
