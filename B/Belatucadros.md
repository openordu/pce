Belatucadros was a Celtic deity, belonging to the Continental Celtic pantheon. This Gaulish god, whose name translates to “fair slayer” or “beautiful in slaughter,” was identified by the Romans as their god of war, Mars. His cult was popular among humble soldiers, as evidenced by the many dedications found in northwestern England, despite not being elaborate. Belatucadros is never depicted with a partner.
