The legendary Black Annis is a figure of British mythology. Located outside of Leicester are the Dane Hills. These hills were named after the ancestral goddess Danu and are believed to be haunted by Black Annis, an intimidating deity figure recognized for her blue face. Although the origin of Black Annis may be linked to Danu, she is portrayed as a degraded goddess. She was known for ambushing and consuming children in a cave referred to as Black Annisâ€™s Bower. Local spring rituals included hare-hunting and dragging a dead cat in front of hounds, both of which are activities Black Annis was sometimes associated with as a hare or a cat. In other stories, Black Annis is described as a former nun who became a cannibal. It's been suggested that she could possibly be a variation of the weather-controlling ancient goddess Cailleach.
