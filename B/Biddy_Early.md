The “White Witch of Clare,” Biddy Early, was a renowned and historical Irish heroine known for her healing abilities in the eastern part of Co. Clare area of Ireland during the 19th century. Despite her death almost a century and a half ago, her name is still remembered. There are many legends surrounding Biddy, depicting her with exaggerated and mythical traits. However, it is clear that these legends are based on a real woman from the Feakle parish situated in the rolling hills of Slieve Aughty (see Echthge). Biddy was believed to possess a magical blue bottle that was gifted to her by the Fairy folk, which she used to diagnose the cause of illness or unhappiness. The clergy frequently disagreed with her methods, labelling her powers as evil. One famous story recounts how she cursed a clergyman for making defamatory statements about her, causing his horse to become trapped until she spoke words that freed it. Biddy had many husbands, each of them progressively younger than the last. Upon her death, she threw her blue bottle into a stream, lake, or river (depending on the speaker), where it is said to rest even today.
