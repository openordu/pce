Brocéliande, an Arthurian site located in eastern Brittany, is a legendary forest that is believed to have been the place where Merlin, the great magician, was imprisoned by his mistress, Viviane. The fair but ambitious woman intended to trick Merlin into relinquishing his magical knowledge, and legend insists that he lives on within a great tree in the region. Additionally, within this multilayered forest is a fountain that, at the behest of its guardian (see Owein and Barenton), stirs up storms in its wake. Known for their belief in the sacredness of trees, the Celts revered this still-standing primeval forest near Rennes (now referred to as the Forest of Paimpont), now potentially recognized as Europe's sole remaining Nemeton.
