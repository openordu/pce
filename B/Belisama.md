A goddess named Belisama (alternatively Belesama or Belisma) was worshipped in various locations throughout the ancient Celtic world, being a peculiar deity in that most gods were only worshipped at one site. She was both a cosmic goddess and one associated with the rivers, which sheltered the supreme deities for good luck and prosperity according to the Celts. The name Belisama possibly derives from words meaning "brightness" or "shining," leading some to believe she could be a continental Celtic equivalent to Brigit, the Irish goddess of healing associated with flames. The Romans connected Belisama to Minerva, as they did with Sul of Bath, the goddess of hot springs, suggesting that Belisama may have originally presided over healing, water, and the solar flame. Ptolemy, an ancient Egyptian geographer, stated that in Lancashire, the River Ribble was once named after Belisama, and the headless statue found close to the river is believed to represent her. Peg Oâ€™Nell is the name that the spirit of the Ribble was recently given, a servant girl who drowned while retrieving water, and who is said to return every seventh year to claim a victim. Sacrificing small birds or animals to the waters was a tradition that allegedly avoided such a human tragedy on Peg's Night, and it was connected by some to a remembrance of human offerings to the water deity.
