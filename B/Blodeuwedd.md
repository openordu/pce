Blodeuwedd, also known as Bloduwith or Blodeuedd, was a Welsh goddess. The story goes that her presumably virgin sister, Arianrhod, was duped into giving birth to a son of questionable lineage whom she cursed to never have a name, weapons or a wife. However, Arianrhod's brother Gwydion tricked her into providing the first two items for the newly-named Lleu Llaw Gyffes. Gwydion then sought the help of his magician uncle Math to create a wife for Lleu, who may have been Gwydion's own son. In the Welsh Mabinogion, which contains tales of Welsh mythology, it is told how the two magicians fashioned Blodeuwedd, whose name means "flower-face," from nine varieties of wildflowers like oak, meadowsweet, broom, primrose, and cockle. But Blodeuwedd, a being of no earthly race, grew dissatisfied with her existence as Lleu's wife and fell in love with a handsome hunter Gronw Pebyr, whom she convinced to kill Lleu. Knowing that Lleu could only be killed while bathing by a river under a thatched roof, standing with one foot on a deer, she challenged Lleu to pose in this unlikely manner, and her lover then easily slew him. As punishment for her involvement in the murder, she was transformed into an Owl by her creators. There are those who argue that this seemingly treacherous woman represents the shadow of an ancient goddess of death, while Robert Graves sees her as an ancient queen whose marriage to the king lasted only a year before his sacrifice.
