Irish mythology recounts the tale of Brí, a heroine whose name was incorporated into the title of the influential Fairy Mound of Brí Léith. She lived in the Sídhe, her father Midir's palace, and was adored by a warrior named Liath. The precise cause and manner of the deaths of both Brí and Liath during her trip to see him in Tara remains unclear. Despite never having been joined in life, the two lovers' names were happily entwined with the naming of Midir's splendid abode.
