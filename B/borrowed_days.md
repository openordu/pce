Mythic tales surround the concept of "borrowed days." These are the stormy days that appear in late spring, when winter seemingly resurrects from its slumber. For the longest time in the western region of Ireland, these days were referred to as the Borrowed Days or Skinning Days. According to legend, the Glas Ghaibhleann, also known as the Old Brindled Cow or Gray Cow, was believed to be a cow of abundance that could not be killed by winter. However, in retaliation, winter stole multiple days from spring and skinned the cow.
