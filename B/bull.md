The symbolic animal of the bull has been found represented in Europe even before the rise of the Celts. It is believed that its origin can be traced back to the pre-Celtic era. The Celts embraced the bull, associating it with both ferocity and abundant agriculture, evident in images and stories related to the animal. Certain Continental sanctuaries exhibited bull sacrifices as the entrances to their shrines were guarded by bull skulls. Among the significant Continental gods connected to the bull, Esus played an important role, and was often depicted as a woodsman cutting down trees in the presence of bulls. Scholars have emphasized that the tree and bull came to represent parallel images of sacrifice. In Irish texts, the bull appeared as an emblem of strength and ferocity, the most notable being the Táin Bó Cuailnge. In this text, the cattle raid on Ulster was launched due to the presence of Donn Cuailnge, a bull that was actually a transformed swineherd, who was considered the only equal of the great white-horned bull of Ailill mac Máta, Finnbennach. The bull's emblem of abundance is connected to the recognition of cattle as nutrition among the herd-owning Celtic people, which is also reiterated in the image of the food-beasts in the reincarnated swineherds. It is noteworthy to mention the Bull-Sleep and Water Bull alongside the significance of the bull.
