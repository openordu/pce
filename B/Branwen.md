Branwen, a Welsh heroine or goddess, appears in the second branch of the Mabinogion. She was the daughter of Llyr, sister of the heroic figure Brân The Blessed, and was married to king Matholwch of Ireland. Branwen's half-brother, Efnisien, caused offense by mutilating the Irish horses, resulting in Branwen being punished as a scullery maid. While in confinement, Branwen trained a starling to deliver messages back to Wales regarding her situation. Her brother Brân led an expedition to rescue her, but the rescue attempt ended in Brân's death. Branwen, overcome with sorrow, also passed away and was buried at the Bedd Branwen barrow, according to tradition. Interestingly, Branwen bears similarities to the Welsh goddess Rhiannon, as both were slaves to their husbands' people and exiled by marriage. Additionally, Branwen's association with the nipple-cairned mountain peak called Branwen’s Seat in the Berwyn range strengthens the interpretation of her as an ancient goddess.
