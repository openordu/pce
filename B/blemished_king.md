Mythic theme: the blemished king. According to Celtic tradition, a king could only marry the goddess of the land and thus reign over the country if he was unblemished. If he became injured, such as in the case of Nuada who lost an arm during the first Battle of Mag Tuired, he was required to give up his throne until a magical prosthesis was provided. This motif can also be seen in the legends of the Fisher King which hold significant importance in the Arthurian cycle.
