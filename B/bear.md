The bear is a symbolic animal that was revered by early people for its strength, impressive speed, and climbing ability despite being dim-sighted. The bear was imagined as almost human, possibly due to its resemblance to a skinned person and its ability to walk upright like a man. The region where the Celts originated, which is mountainous central Europe, was an ideal habitat for bears, which may have contributed to their significance in Celtic mythology. Before the emergence of the Celts, evidence suggests that there was a bear cult in Alpine caves, which probably influenced the Celtic belief in the bear's divine nature. The bear's importance is also evident in Swiss sites, particularly in the city of Berne, whose name means "bear," where the Celtic bear goddess Artio's sculpture was discovered. A bear god named Artaios, who the Romans called Mercury, existed alongside the goddess. In addition, the name of Andarta, a goddess with Gaulish origins, may mean "great bear." Finally, Arthur and Cormac Mac Airt are other mythological figures with ursine names.
