Symbolic creatures, bees are sparsely featured in Celtic mythology. Their appearances are often linked to Wisdom. A prevailing belief was that bees descended to the earth from the heavens above. Fishermen on the Isle of Man caught bees in early spring and kept them as protective Amulets to ensure they were safe whilst at sea. Conspicuously absent in Ireland's pre-Christian symbolism, some beekeepers were linked to saints such as Domn贸c in Wales and Gobnat in Munster.
