A British and Scottish mythological creature, the barguest was often difficult to differentiate from Brownies, Bogies and boggarts (see Brownie). This being, found in Scotland and England, was capable of appearing in various forms, such as a headless man, a ghostly rabbit, or a white cat. In particular, the barguest could take on the appearance of a Black Dog, which usually happened when influential local people passed away. During such times, the fire-eyed barguest would induce all the dogs in the area to wail infernally. Encountering the barguest was considered perilous, as its bite would not heal. The meaning of its name has been suggested to be “bear-ghost” or “BARROWghost,” the latter implying that it haunted ancient stone graves.
