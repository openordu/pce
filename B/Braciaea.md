A Continental Celtic divinity known as Braciaea represents an enigmatic Gallic deity. In Roman mythology, he was identified as Mars, the god of war. Braciaea's name is plausibly linked to a Gaulish or Welsh term that means "malt". This indicates that there could be a correlation between drunkenness and hostility. It is also reflective of the Celtic practice of serving their fighters alcoholic drinks prior to entering the battlefield.
