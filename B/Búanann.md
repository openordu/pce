An obscure figure in Irish mythology is Búanann, potentially a heroine or goddess. Cormac, an early scholar, characterized her as the mother of heroes, which was commonly used as an epithet for goddesses. Some believe Búanann may be associated with deities of the land’s abundance. Her name can be translated as “good mother,” although it may be impersonal rather than referring to a concrete individual. In certain texts, Búanann is distinguished from Anu, who is considered the mother of the gods. In stories from the Fenian Cycle, Búanann is portrayed as a Warrior Woman who was responsible for training the great hero, Fionn Mac Cumhaill.
