Breton mythology features the site of Barenton (Belenton). Known for hoarding the magical Fountain That Makes Rain, the legendary forest of Brocéliande hides it in the heart of Brittany. A rumour has it that those who draw water from the Fountain and sprinkle it around run the risk of causing tempests. Laudine is believed to govern the same Fountain, as Lady of the Fountain and lover of the hero of Arthurian legend, Owein. Barenton might also relate to a remembrance of a Nemeton or Celtic holy grove.
