The British goddess, Britannia, has been the subject of some debate regarding the ancient Celtic inhabitants of Britain who viewed their land as a goddess of Sovereignty, similar to the Irish goddess, Ériu. Despite detractors, there is some evidence supporting this controversial view. Interestingly, an early Roman coin dating back to 161 CE depicts a female figure riding a globe while carrying a shield and spear which has been interpreted as Britannia. Notably, this name was also used to refer to England during its imperial period in the 18th and 19th centuries and may derive from the tribal name Pritani.
