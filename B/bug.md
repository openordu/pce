A particular syllable, 'bug', is commonly found in the names of many mischievous sprites in different Celtic countries, such as bug-a-boo, bugbear, bullbeggar, bogle, Bogie, Bogan, and boggart, to name a few. Some argue that this frequency suggests these creatures are minor deities, as 'boge' is a word with divine meaning in other Indo-European languages. However, some scholars completely reject this interpretation. Others have connected the word 'bug' with 'Bog', a location viewed as a threshold to the Otherworld. In the Isle of Man, a bug or buggane was said to haunt St. Trinian’s, a church rumored to have been erected by St. Ninian during the 12th century. The church remained unroofed as every time roofers attempted the task, the buggane destroyed their work. In a bid to undo the buggane’s magic, a tailor sewed the roof to the rafters but the buggane threw his own head at him, chasing him away. Though the buggane never reappeared, the roof was never completed.
