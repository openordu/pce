Mythic theme: Birth. The Celts did not assume fertility in nature, be it in the fields, the herds, or in humans. There are numerous recorded invocations and rituals that the Celts practiced to enhance fertility, indicating its importance as a serious concern. The act of giving birth was fraught with dangers, hence the need for protective rituals to ensure safe childbirth, such as drinking from holy Wells or wearing clothing dipped in them. Since many wells also served as oracles, expectant parents probably sought their advice regarding the anticipated child.
