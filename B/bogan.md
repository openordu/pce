The bogan, also known as buckawn, b√≤can or bauchan, is a Scottish (sometimes Irish) legendary character. A shapeshifting night sprite, this being was known for being a trickster that could sometimes be of assistance, but was usually malevolent. Mainly found in the Highlands, and to a lesser extent in Ireland, the bogan also made appearances in America alongside the people it served or tormented. In the village of Morar, the MacDonald family coexisted with a bogan that they called Coluinn gun Cheann. Although the creature was friendly towards the family, it had the reputation for killing visitors, leaving their mutilated remains close to the local river. Ultimately, it killed a man which led to his friend, a powerful individual by the name of John MacLeod, seeking revenge against the bogan. MacLeod wrestled the creature to the ground and threatened to expose it to dangerous daylight. In response, the bogan begged to be freed and vowed to leave the land, which it eventually did, keeping its promise.
