Breton heroine, Blondine (also known as Velandinenn or Princess Velandinnen), has captured the hearts of many with her enchanting story, filled with elements of mythology, leading to conjectures of her possible origin as a goddess. According to a folktale from Brittany, when a young man named Cado dishonoured a mysterious Fairy, she cursed him and the only way to break the curse was for him to marry the unknown Princess Blondine. Despite the fact that no human knew the way to Blondineâ€™s kingdom, Cado overheard some Crows mentioning her name and managed to ride on one to reach her. There he found her beneath a tree (known as Bile) beside a crystal-clear Well. Cado managed to convince Blondine to marry him; they ran away from her magician father, who tried unsuccessfully to cast spells on the couple. Unfortunately, on Earth, Cado betrayed Blondine by losing the ring she had given him, resulting in his memory of her being wiped clean. He was due to wed another woman, but Blondine arrived at the wedding wearing the matching ring, and he instantly regained his memory and sense. Cado's brother married the other bride, and Cado and Blondine, at last, lived happily ever after.
