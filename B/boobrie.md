A Scottish folkloric figure known as the boobrie (tarbh boibhre) is a shape-shifting specter of Highland tradition. It was often seen as a Cow or a Water Horse, and on occasion, it would take on the form of a massive insect with long tentacles that would suck horsesâ€™ blood. Haunting Lakes, the boobrie would cry like a strange bird and frequently assume the form of a waterbird that was much larger than any duck or swan ever seen. Its footprint on land was said to be as large as a deer's antlers. The boobrie preyed upon livestock such as calves and lambs, making it a threat to subsistence farmers. When cattle were not available, it would feed on Otters.
