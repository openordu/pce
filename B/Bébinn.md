Irish literature and legend mention Bébinn, also known as Bebind, Bé Find, Be Bind, Be Find, Bebhionn, Befind, or Befionn. Bébinn is either a heroine or a goddess. One Bébinn is the goddess of birth, who is the sister of Bóand and the mother of Fráech — the most handsome hero of Ireland. Another Bébinn is a beautiful Giant who lived in Maiden's Land, located off the west coast, surrounded by magical Birds. This second Bébinn may have initially been the goddess of pleasure. According to the legend, this Bébinn left the Otherworld, settling with the king of the Isle of Man. However, she escaped when he started beating her. Unfortunately, the king chased and killed his fleeing wife, resulting in a sad yet realistic ending.
