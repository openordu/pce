In Co. Cork lies the Blarney Stone, a stone located in the 15th-century Blarney Castle that is believed to bestow the gift of eloquence, even without sincerity, to anyone who kisses it. Legend has it that the stone was consecrated by Clídna, the Fairy Queen of the region, after the resident leader Cormac MacCarthy had requested her assistance in winning a legal action. Following Clídna's guidance, MacCarthy bestowed a kiss upon the stone at sunrise and was instantly rewarded with silver-tongued speech, using which he emerged victorious from his legal battle. To prevent others from benefiting from the same gift, MacCarthy had the stone embedded in an unreachable area of the castle wall where it can be seen today. Tourists often hang upside down to kiss the stone and earn Clídna's gift.
