Briccriu, also known as Bricriu Nemhthenga or Bricriu of the Poisonous Tongue, was an Irish hero. He is famous for his sharp tongue and his role in causing bloodshed among great champions, as chronicled in the epic Briccriu’s Feast, and in the story of Mac Dathó’s Pig. These texts underscore the power of Irish poets, whose words were believed to have magical powers over men. According to legend, Briccriu met his end near Loughbrickland, which is named after him, when he insulted queen Medb's sexual appetite and was killed by her lover Fergus mac Róich.
