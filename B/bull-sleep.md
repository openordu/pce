The Irish and Scottish peoples conducted a fascinating and ancient ceremony known as the tarbhfleis or bull-sleep, which was a significant Divination ritual. This ritual was used to establish who the legitimate ruler of Tara was. It involved a specially-trained seer who, after consuming the flesh of a freshly slaughtered Bull, slept wrapped in its bloody hide in the hope of dreaming about the identity of the next king. If the seer failed to receive a vision, they would be put to death. The visions that the poet sometimes received were obscure, such as when Conaire, who was descended from a bird, materialized naked, surrounded by Birds, and heading to Tara. At that instant, Conaire perceived that he should approach Tara in the same way. A comparable custom existed among the Scottish Highlanders, who entwined a diviner with bulls' hides and left them to dream of the future. One literary tourist from 1769 described a ritual of terrible solemnity that people in the Trotternish district performed. In this version of the ritual, a person was sewn inside a hide from an ox and then slept beneath a waterfall of considerable height to learn premonitions.
