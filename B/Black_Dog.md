A spectral creature known as the Black Dog played a significant role in the mythologies of Ireland, Scotland, and Britain. This creature was typically shaggy and about the size of a calf. Throughout the Celtic world, it served as an ominous warning of impending and significant change or possible death. Although occasionally helpful, one had to be cautious of the Black Dog because even a single glance from its eyes could be fatal. In the north of England, this creature was referred to as the Barguest, and it was thought to be a harbinger of death. The Barguest led all the dogs of a district on a frenzied rampage in an area where death was imminent, creating a memorable disturbance with their howling. Meanwhile, in East Anglia, the Black Dog was known as Black Shuck, while in Cumbria, it was called Shriker. In Westmoreland, the creature took the name Capelthwaite, and it performed dog-like services for the locals, such as rounding up herds. On the Isle of Man, the creature was known as the Mauthe Doog. Sightings of the Black Dog have continued through Irish folklore, with recent sightings occurring as late as the 1990s at Irish sacred sites. It is possible that legends and stories about this ghostly creature inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to write “The Hound of the Baskervilles.”
