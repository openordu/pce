An Irish mythological being known as Ban Naemha (Ban Naema) is prominent in the story of a magical Fish that swims in a holy Well throughout Ireland. In Cork, the sun-well, Kil-na-Greina was believed to be Ban Naemha's dwelling place. Only those who were gifted with Second Sight could see the fish of wisdom. The well’s ritual involved taking three sips of the well’s water, crawling around the well three times between each drink, and offering a stone the size of a dove’s egg with each circuit. It is not clear if the purpose of these actions was to attract the fish or to pay homage to the place.
