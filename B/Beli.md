Celtic ancestry is embodied by Beli, who is also likely a god, according to scholars. Beli Mawr, or Beli Mawr fab Mynogan, is the Welsh ancestral patriarch who might be an offshoot of the Celtic deity Belenus, given that so little is known about the latter. In various texts, Beli is depicted as the consort of the mother goddess DÔN and is the parent of the goddess Arianrhod and warrior Caswallawn; in the story of Maxen, Beli is said to have reigned over Britain until the titular protagonist arrived with his army, forcing him into the ocean. Beli has been recognized as a god of death and sea, and the phrase “Beli’s liquor” is a poetic depiction of the ocean; his name appears to be embedded in the London location of Billingsgate (Beli’s gate). There have been efforts to link him with the obscure Irish divinity Bile (see Bile).
