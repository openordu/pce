A symbolic animal within Celtic mythology is the bird. Birds oftentimes served as emblems or escorts of Celtic goddesses, specifically the carrion-eaters like Crows or Ravens that would accompany the goddesses of war and death. Birds were sometimes used to represent souls departing from the body, a fitting symbol due to their connection with warrior goddesses. Alternatively, they could also serve as a means of divination, where the designs formed by birds in flight were interpreted. Not all bird imagery in Celtic mythology was associated with gloom or foreboding. Some goddesses, such as Rhiannon, were accompanied by sweetly singing birds that surrounded her, bringing joy wherever she went. Cl√≠dna's bright-feathered companions sought to ease the pains of the sick with their songs. Each individual bird species held specific associated traditions. For a deeper understanding of the significance of the Cock, Crane, Dove, Duck, Eagle, Egret, Goose, Heron, Owl, Swallow, Swan, and Wren within Celtic mythology, refer to these entries.
