There exists a folkloric figure called Bendonner who terrorized the coast of Ulster until the locals called for help from Finn Mccool, a folkloric representation of the great Irish hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Finn accepted the challenge to fight the Scottish Giant and cleverly disguised himself in swaddling clothes. Upon arriving, the monster discovered an enormous baby in an immense cradle and was frightened by its strength. He fled without any action from Finn and never caused any problems for the people of Ulster again.
