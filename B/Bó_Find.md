A magical white Cow named Bó Find emerged with her sisters, Bó Ruadh and Bó Dhu, from the western sea when Ireland was an infertile and unpopulated island. The red cow, Bó Ruadh, traveled north while the black cow, Bó Dhu, headed south, with Bó Find travelling to the center of the island. The three cows brought life to Ireland as they traveled their separate ways. Upon arrival at the center of the island, Bó Find gave birth to twin calves that were male and female, and all of Ireland's Cattle are said to have descended from them. Several sites along her path still bear names that include "Bó," including the famous island of Inis Bó Find, now known as Inisbofin, which is considered sacred. For more on this topic, please see Bóand.
