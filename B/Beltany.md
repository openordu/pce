In the far northwestern county of Donegal, there is a mythological site called Beltany. It consists of a large circle comprised of about 60 stones, which used to reflect the rays of the rising sun on the morning of Beltane, which is May 1st. The alignment between a pillar stone and another stone engraved with small cup marks shows the sunrise on this day. Although most stone circles in Ireland that indicate astronomical alignments have been built as early as 4,000 years before the Celts arrived, Beltany predates the Celts and therefore presents an archaeological conundrum. The pre-Celtic builders of stone circles typically marked the equinoxes themselves, so it remains a mystery whether Beltany is synchronous with Celtic sites, inspired by them, or simply an astronomical coincidence.
