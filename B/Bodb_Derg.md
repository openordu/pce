The wise Bodb Derg was a powerful magician who featured as a hero or god in Irish mythology. He was born the son of Dagda, who was a good god, and the brother of Aonghus Óg, who presided over poetry as a god. Bodb Derg was elected to be the king of the Tuatha Dé Danann, reigning from a grand palace situated on the shores of Lough Derg. This action caused Lir to be annoyed and he left the meeting in anger. Unfortunately, Lir found his wife to have become ill upon his return home, and she died three days later. In a gesture of solidarity, Bodb Derg sent his three foster daughters to Shee Finnaha, Lir's palace, to provide care for him. Of the three daughters, the eldest, whose name is Áeb, caught Lir's eye, and soon after, they fell in love. However, after giving birth to Fionnuala and her brothers, Áeb died. Lir then married his wife's foster sister, Aífe, who became envious of her stepchildren and enchanted them into swans. Bodb Derg could not undo Aífe's powerful spell, but he did punish her by turning her into a demon or a crane.
