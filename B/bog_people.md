Unearthed in bogs across Europe during peat harvesting are the bog people, ancient bodies of people who were either drowned in bog lakes or sacrificed in ancient times. The preservative power of bog water has caused these bodies to be well preserved, although their skin is now brown due to the tannic acid. Archaeologists have closely examined these bodies to try to determine if their deaths were accidental or if they were sacrificed as part of a religious ritual, as is sometimes evident. Although most of the sacrificed bodies have been found in European bogs, there have also been discoveries in Celtic lands. Among the most prominent of these finds is the Lindow Man, discovered in Lindow near Liverpool in 1984. An analysis of his body revealed that he was garroted or strangled after being given mistletoe pollen, indicating that he was subjected to human sacrifice and the Threefold Death.
