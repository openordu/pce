A Scottish and British mythical figure, known as the brownie, has been a source of inspiration for many. Juliette Gordon Low, a feminist, named the youngest members of Girl Scouts after these helpful household spirits that were traditionally seen as friendly members of the Fairy race. While some argue that brownie may not have roots in the Celtic or pre-Celtic worldviews, there is evidence to suggest that it is a late mythological development. One theory suggests that brownie may have emerged from ancestor worship, in which forebears are imagined to be hanging around to help the living. However, due to its close relationships with fairies, brownie may have an exalted past as well. The specialized brownie, called the Gruagach, had divine qualities, and people used to pour milk offerings over its sacred stones to persuade it to protect their herds. Brownie's appearance is also a debatable topic, with some believing it to be a stout, hairy man, while others believe it to be fair and flowing-haired, not necessarily rotund. Brownie typically wore ragged brown clothes but could sometimes take on the form of a female. Brownie's specialty was doing barn work at night, which included threshing, tidying, currying horses, and more. They also worked outdoors with sheepherding, mowing, running errands, and could even be a confidante and adviser if needed. Having a brownie in the household was considered a blessing, and a visible representation of one was a good omen. The brownie was occasionally given milk in a special vessel, but it was crucial not to draw too much attention to his needs or shoddy attire in the presence of the other supernatural beings living there. Should anyone offer a human outfit, the brownie would swiftly quit his loyalties and find work elsewhere. The boggart, a hobgoblin notorious for causing mayhem and throwing things around the house, was commonplace in Cornwall and could emerge if mistreated by his host family. Other Celtic regions featured similar beings, such as Wales' Bucca, the Highland Bodach and the Manx fenodyree (see Glastig).
