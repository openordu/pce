Obscure in her worship, Berecynthia was a Continental Celtic goddess who was conveyed, as recounted by the early Christian author Gregory of Tours, in the form of a white-veiled image through the fields during springtime and whenever crops were at risk of failing. She is said to possibly be linked to Brigindo, another lesser-known Celtic Fertility goddess confined to a specific region. However, it is improbable that any depictions of Berecynthia exist today as most had been destroyed by Martin of Tours, Gregoryâ€™s coreligionist, who had eradicated the majority of the "pagan idols" in the area.
