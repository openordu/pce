Symbolic of the birch tree holds significant value as it is considered one of the sacred trees in the Celtic tradition. The second letter in the Tree Alphabet, the birch is a delicate but elegant tree with white bark that is short-lived. It was used as a source of wood for the Maypoles, which were instrumental in the Beltane dances.
