The brehon, or Irish judge, was a member of the Druid class in ancient Ireland. Unlike modern-day lawyers and judges, they did not evaluate cases or enforce the law, as these were duties of the king. Instead, the brehons relied on their precognitive abilities and knowledge of history and poetry, which they had learned during many years of training, to provide guidance for their people. They were also spiritually bound to act justly, as Sencha, a great judge, was said to have developed blotches on his skin when issuing a biased judgment regarding women. Some brehons wore special garments or jewelry that kept them honest. For instance, Morann, another great judge, had a chain around his neck that tightened and choked him if he pronounced a false judgment, but grew looser and comfortable when he spoke the truth. Although some sources mention Brig, a renowned female brehon who corrected Sencha's biased judgment and healed his skin, scholars debate whether women were allowed to act as brehons. While there are reports of women serving in this capacity, many assert that women were not permitted to function as brehons. Nevertheless, some scholars have argued that the possibility of female jurists suggests gender equity in ancient Irish society. However, given the scarcity of evidence, many researchers have projected their own visions and misgivings onto the past, making this topic one of the most hotly debated in Celtic studies. The issue of women serving as brehons is an unsettled matter. The brehon laws, which were formulated during ancient times and handed down through oral tradition, were officially compiled for the first time during the fifth or sixth century. The brehons continued to function up until the seventeenth century. However, the Case of Tanistry in 1608 led to Ireland being subjected to British common law. The proponents of the British common law considered the brehon laws to be responsible for "barbarism and desolation."
