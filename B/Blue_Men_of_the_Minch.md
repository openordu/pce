Fir Gorm, or Fir Ghorma, are Scottish folkloric figures. Along Scotland's coastal waters between the inner and outer Hebrides lies the Minch. This area is haunted by beings with blue skin who may have originated from seals or may be fallen angels. The Blue Men have control of the weather and ship traffic in that region. Even when the sea is calm, the Minch can be turbulent as it is said that the Blue Men swim about, stirring the waters. The Current of Destruction or Blue Men's Stream are alternate names for the Minch because of its unpredictable and dangerous waters. Skippers who are not quick thinkers are discouraged from passing through the passage, as the Blue Men often call out rhymes to them. If a suitable retort is not given in the form of a good couplet, they capsize the boat.
