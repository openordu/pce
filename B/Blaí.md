Irish mythology features Blaí as a significant figure, a heroine who bore Oisín. Oisín was one of the poets among the renowned band of heroes called the Fianna. Sadly, Blaí was transformed into a deer during a magical attack by an enemy, but as a deer, she conceived her son by Fionn Mac Cumhaill. At the time of Oisín's birth, Blaí received a warning not to touch him, but her love was too strong, and she gently stroked him with her tongue, leaving a small furry patch permanently on his forehead. It is worth mentioning that sometimes, this heroic figure is referred to as Sadb.
