A site of symbolic significance, the bog is essentially a collection of sphagnum moss and various plants compacted underwater for centuries. Bogs were a prominent feature in Ireland and Scotland for a long time. The peat harvested from bogs remains a popular fuel source that is still used in both countries. Before the mid-20th century, harvesting turf was a laborious process, but thanks to mechanical innovations, ancient bogs have been destroyed in both countries. This destruction has had the consequence of losing many folklore sites, as bogs are typically liminal zones (see Liminality): neither dry nor wet. This makes it difficult to build roads or homes, making bogs the perfect entrance to the Otherworld. From an archaeological standpoint, bogs hold a great deal of importance. The lack of oxygen and excess of tannic acid in bog water means that objects lost or sacrificed in bogs (see Bog People) are strikingly well-preserved. The National Museum of Ireland has on display many of the archaeological riches uncovered in bogs.
