Scottish mythology features the bogie (also known as bogle, bug, or bug-a-boo), a type of trickster character common in the Scottish Highlands. Bogle Day falls on March 29 and is a celebration of these creatures, which can also be found in England, alone or in troops known as Trooping Fairies. Bogies often reside in high places like trees, attics and lofts. They come in many varieties based on their clothing and behaviors, including the helpful Brownie, tormenting boggart, and destructive Nuckelavee. In addition, various goblins appear in devilish skeletal form.
