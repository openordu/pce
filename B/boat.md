The boat is a symbolic entity which holds great significance in connection to the Celtic goddess of waters. During the Roman period, sculptures were found that incorporated this important image. In particular, the goddess from Nuits-Saint-Georges in France was showcased holding a Cornucopia while standing on the prow and rudder of a boat, although the goddess herself was not named. These symbols were also linked with the Roman goddess Fortuna, which suggests that the boat could serve as a connection between the ideas of Fertility (as perceived by the Celts because water nourished the land) and abundance (as the Romans associated Fortuna with the goddess of fortune). For further reference, please see Nehalennia.
