The boar holds symbolic importance as an animal. Celts encountered the male pig or wild boar, which was depicted in art and coins from both insular and continental sources, representing the most savage animal they were to encounter. As a result, the boar came to represent strength, tenacity, and sexual potency. It was commonly consumed as part of the Champion's portion, which was often praised in song and story. The boar's skin was used for warriors' cloaks, and it represented prosperity, as its meat was highly favored. Various Gaelic languages refer to the boar as Torc, which is also the word for the warrior's neckpiece. The boar is frequently mentioned in important cycles of Irish legend, particularly in the story of Diarmait Ua Duibine, who kills a boar that was causing mayhem only to die when he stepped on one of its poisonous bristles while measuring its size. Legends also mention an otherworldly pig that could be endlessly replenished as it was carved up and devoured. In the Welsh Mabinogion, boars originate from the Otherworld, which may account for their fierce strength in the surface world.
