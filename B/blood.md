Sacred blood holds a prominent place in the myths of the Celts. Ancient Roman writers portrayed the Celts as revering blood and engaging in ghastly rituals that included consuming the blood of their enemies. However, it is important to consider the motives of these writers, who wrote to a Roman audience already intimidated by the Celts, conquerors of Rome itself. Thus, these accounts may exaggerate the barbarism of the Celts. Nevertheless, other evidence suggests that the Celts did practice blood rituals. For example, blood brotherhood persisted as a tradition into historical times in the Scottish isles, and animal sacrifices involved smearing the blood on trees in sacred groves, or Nemetons. The Celts may have seen blood as carrying a life force, and consuming it could restore a warrior's vigor.
