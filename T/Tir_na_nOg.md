The Land of Youth, also known as Tir na nOg (Tir Na n-og), is an Irish mythological site. It was one of the many titles used for the Otherworld, often confused or merged with Fairyland. The Tuatha DÃ© Danann, ancient gods, were banished from this world and transformed into Fairies. The reason behind the name is that the Otherworld's inhabitants never age, and they enjoy a blissful life full of dance, love, and fruit from the evergreen trees, completely free from mortality. Legend has it that Tir na nOg's gateway is located beneath the Lough Gur, a mystical lake in the vicinity.
