Minor British goddess Triduana, who shares a similar tale with Ireland's Brigit, reportedly pulled her own eyes out of her head in order to evade an unwelcome suitor. It could be postulated that Triduana's appellation was a provincial epithet for the goddess, as Brigit was considered a triple goddess and the name Triduana possesses the syllable for "three."
