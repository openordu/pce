In the folklore of those who used to make their livelihood from the drained fens of England, there was a multifaceted belief system that is sadly almost completely forgotten. Allegedly, among the spirits thought to reside in the watery fens dwelt Tiddy Mun, a kind soul with white hair who safeguarded those who cared for the land. Whenever the waters in the fen rose during stormy weather conditions, the fen people would pray for Tiddy Mun's intervention with the words, "Tiddy Mun! Tiddy Mun! You without a name, walking lame, harm none, Tiddy Mun, harm none, harm none." Since the draining of the fens to expand agricultural land, Tiddy Mun's special niche has been destroyed, and he has not been sighted in recent times.
