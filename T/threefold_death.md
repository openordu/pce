The Celts are believed to have performed a ritual called the threefold death, which involved a form of sacrificial death with three parts. This involved stabbing, burning, and drowning, with an alternative version consisting of strangling, cutting, and drowning. Evidence suggests that sacrifice was often carried out in honour of specific gods; those offered to Taranis were burnt, those offered to Teutates were drowned, and those who went to Esus were hanged. Numerous texts in Ireland make reference to the threefold death. For example, Muircertach Mac Erc was wounded, then as he tried to escape his burning house, he fell and drowned in a vat of wine. Another example is the failed king Conaire who was badly wounded, struck by an unquenchable thirst and then burned alive. The body of a victim found in Lindow Bog in Britain, known as the Lindow Man had evidence of a noose around his neck, a throat slit and was drowned in the bogwater. Some argue that the Celts believed in reincarnation and the ritual offering of a human life to attain a community good was seen as a noble way to die. It must be noted that the question of whether the Celts did practice human sacrifice is still not fully settled.
