Tommy Rawhead, also known as Rawhead-and-BloodyBones or Old Bloody Bones, is a figure in British folklore. In the previous century, informants held different beliefs about where this terrifying Bogie resided. Some claimed that he was a water demon who haunted bogs and other gloomy locations, whereas others believed he dwelt beneath stairs and in disused cupboards. Regardless of location, the creature was unspeakably hideous, perched atop a heap of bones with blood oozing from its mouth.
