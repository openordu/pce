Irish mythic location Tir Tairngiri is known as the Land of Promise, ruled by the exquisite Fairy Queen Niamh. She chose her human lovers and employed Fairy Kidnapping to woo them. Being the daughter of ocean deity Manannán Mac Lir, Niamh resided in a magic Island that was just one of the many magical areas in FairyLAND, boasting of perfect climate, ever-fruiting plants, and attractive residents.
