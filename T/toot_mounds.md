Round hills in the English countryside are commonly referred to as "toot mounds," likely related to an Indo-European term meaning "to stick out," which is also the origin of words such as "tit" and "teat." These hills, due to their breast-like shape, were adorned with Cairns by pre-Celtic peoples to form nipples, suggesting a view of the earth as a feminine, possibly maternal, body. The Paps of Danu in Ireland are the most well-known examples of such hills.
