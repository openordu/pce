Llyn Tegid, the largest lake in northern Wales, is the Welsh mythological site known today as Lake Bala. Ceridwen, the great goddess, made her home there and brewed a magical potion in a cauldron. One day, she left the young Gwion in charge of the cauldron while she went to do other tasks. Gwion accidentally swallowed some of the potion and gained both poetic talent and wisdom. Fearful of Ceridwen's wrath, Gwion fled the scene, but she eventually discovered what had happened and chased him. Despite his shape-shifting ability, Gwion was eventually consumed by the goddess, only to be reborn as Taliesin, the great Bard. Lake Bala remained a mystical place in local folklore, with tales of its depth being immeasurable, and anyone who tried to measure it would be met with a booming voice commanding them to stop. Dragons were also said to live in the lake's bottomless depths.
