In Celtic mythology, twin deities were often depicted and were believed to hold symbolic value by the Celts. The Celts, who considered three as the most significant number, saw twin gods as significant too. Twin goddesses who gave birth to two children, one being dark and the other light, were frequently portrayed in Celtic mythology. The Romans linked their Twin Gods, Castor and Pollux, with the Celtic twin deities. In Welsh mythology, Twrch Trwyth plays a significant role - a monster that appeared as a Boar but was a cursed king, who Kulhwch had to capture as part of his quest to get married. Mabon, who was freed from a spell by magic, helped Kulhwch in the hunt for Twrch Trwyth to complete his quest. Kulhwch's name meaning “pigrun” hints at the connection between the hunter and prey. The tylwyth teg, small fairy-like creatures of Welsh folklore, were often referred to as “fair family” to keep them from being impolite or unlucky. In Wales, these fairies wore homespun clothes of blue, unlike most fairies who wore Green or Red. Gwynn Ap Nudd was the king of the tylwyth teg. Morgan wrote that petroleum was their staple and toadstools their sustenance. Uathe was a legendary Irish figure who played the harp for the god Dagda. Uathe eloped with Dagda's consort, Boand, and fathered three children, including the musically gifted Súantrade. Dagda's magical harp was also known as Uathe. Uathach of the Glen was a Scottish mythological character who confronted the young hero Cúchulainn at her mother's borders but was unable to defeat him. Uathach assisted Cúchulainn in his martial arts training, and they became lovers. Cúchulainn left Uathach to return to his intended wife, Emer. In some versions, Uathach gifted Cúchulainn the Gáe Bulga, his most potent weapon, for his sexual prowess. Uath mac Imoman was an Irish mythological figure who challenged all of Ireland's heroes to cut off his head, with the condition that he would do the same afterward. Three Ulster warriors were tasked with defeating the great Uath. Only Cúchulainn accepted the challenge, despite knowing that Uath had Fairy blood and could regrow his head. Cúchulainn’s bravery paid off, as Uath’s sword could not harm him. This earned him the title of the greatest warrior in the land. However, this accolade caused trouble when Briccriu used it to incite the other warriors against him. 

Ucuetis was a lesser-known god in Continental Celtic mythology. He was the consort of the goddess Berguisa and depicted carrying a Hammer, which some believe made him similar to the Irish god of fertility, Dagda, or a local form of the hammer-wielding deity Sucellus. 

Uffington is a place known for the White Horse of Uffington, an ancient prehistoric hill figure in the form of a horse.

Uicce was an unknown leader of the Milesians, an important early Irish warrior mentioned in the Book of Invasions.

Uigreann or Uirgriu was a minor hero in Irish mythology who played a significant role despite his obscurity. He was killed by the great hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill, who, in turn, was killed by Uigreann’s five sons who threw their spears at the same time.

Uirne, also known as Tuiren, Tuirn, or Tuirreann was a figure in Irish mythology. She was the mother of the favorite hunting dogs of the heroic Fionn Mac Cumhaill, Bran, and Sceolan. Uirne was transformed into a Dog by a jealous rival, while she was pregnant, after which she gave birth to twin puppies. Their mother's spell was lifted, yet her twins were left in the form of canines indefinitely. Uisneach, a site in Irish mythology, can be found in the heart of Ireland. A small hill situated close to the village of Ballymore in Co. Westmeath, Uisneach affords a breathtaking panoramic view such that one may survey almost the entire island from its peak. From Celtic cosmology, the center is not so much a physical as a metaphoric or spiritual location, and so, like Tara, Uisneach bears the distinction of being Ireland's center. Although the two hills are equal, they symbolize different powers: Tara is mainly linked with political and regal history, while Uisneach—a place the Druids ruled instead of the kings— is the center of spiritual power. The ancients recognized the relationship between the two hills, as Giraldus Cambrensis points out, describing them as "alike as two kidneys." Despite their equivalence, Uisneach is of greater mythological significance than Tara, though the latter dominates in popularity. The last group of invaders, known as the Milesians, encountered Ériu, the most important goddess of the land, on Uisneach. They had already encountered Ériu's two sisters, Banba and Fódla, each situated on her own mountain. For each encounter, the Milesians had promised to name the land after the goddess if she would let their armies proceed without resistance. The goddesses Banba and Fódla agreed to let them pass, thus allowing the Milesians to make their way to the center of the island. It was here that they met Ériu. The Milesians were so impressed by Ériu's power and wealth that they reneged on their previous promises, allowing the island to still bear her name today. The local legend tells of Ériu's burial beneath the Stone of Divisions, a significant boulder that, located on the slope of Uisneach, marks the precise location where the four Provinces converge. The Stone of Divisions, which is known as "the naval of Ireland," supposedly portrays the map of Ireland on its broken surface. However, the most common version of the myth asserts that the god Lugh, rather than Ériu, was slain on the hill by three other gods: Mac Cuill, Mac Cécht, and Mac Gréine. The last of these gods was Ériu's husband. The myths exhibit some fragmentation and inner conflicts, but the connection between Uisneach, the magical center of the island, and its tutelary goddess is constant. The Fomorians, an age-old race of monsters who fought against the Tuatha Dé Danann, were apparently the first inhabitants of the hill. In times past, the Fomorians imposed a tax on the Tuatha Dé, demanding payment for kneading-troughs, querns, baking stones, and every male member of the tribe. Failure to pay the tax meant the loss of one's nose. When the Tuatha Dé finally defeated the Fomorians, Uisneach became the residence of a peculiar druid named Mide, whose name has a dual meaning, signifying both "middle" and his physical location atop the hill. Mide lit an enormous fire on the hill, fed by offerings from other druids in Ireland. Those who objected to paying this tax incurred Mide's wrath and all were killed, their tongues removed and buried in the hill. This practice gave rise to the hill's name, "Over Somewhat," though it may also refer to the hill's impressive view. Other interpretations of the name suggest "Proudly," both for Mide's proud posture over the buried tongues and for the overall power and mystique of the hill itself. Another version of the story attributes the lighting of the Uisneach fire to Delbáeth, a druid or goddess associated with fire, from whose blaze five great points of light emanated. Certain scholars view the theme of mutilation as indicative of cultural change and the social subjugation that usually accompanies it. Fires feature prominently in the mythology of Uisneach and were also significant in ritual contexts. Every year on this summit, for instance, the first Beltane fire was kindled. The hill of Tara is believed to have responded to the twin fires of Uisneach's peak with its own conflagration, leading to the lighting of hilltop fires throughout Ireland. Early records imply that Tara was not the only hill where ceremonies took place. Knockaulin and Tlachtga, hills in the vicinity, also played a significant role. The Beltane fires used to be lit at Uisneach hill during historical times. Cattle were driven between the fires as a ritualistic prayer for protection against disease and bad magic. Uisneach was also the site for a significant assembly (Óenach), probably held during Beltane. Even today, the assemblies still take place in a non-religious format, functioning instead as cattle fairs, given that the surrounding area of Uisneach is widely known to be fertile, making it ideal for herds. Though there is uncertainty about the connection between the mythological figure of Uisneach and Uisneach hill. There isn’t much of a narrative about the warrior Uisneach, except that his wife was Ebhla, who was Cathbad's daughter, the evil Druid who features prominently in the Ulster Cycle. His wife, Maga, was an obscure daughter of Aonghus Óg, the god of poetry. The Sons of Uisneach are central characters in one of the Three Sorrows of Ireland stories (see Deirdre).

- Ulster Cycle (Red Branch Cycle). Irish mythological texts. The series of tales about the Province of Ulster that make up the Ulster Cycle are among the most renowned in Irish literature. The Cycle begins with Macha, a goddess or Fairy Queen who was betrayed by her human husband. He wagered that she could outrun king Concobar Mac Nessa’s best horses, and so she did, despite being ready to give birth to Twins. As she died bearing her children, Macha leveled a curse that all the men of the province would fall down in intense pain whenever invasion threatened (see Debility Of The UlsterMEN). This left the province vulnerable to attack, which it suffered when queen Medb of Connacht marched upon the land, intent upon seizing the great bull Donn Cuailnge, in order to settle a dispute with her consort Ailill mac Máta. The greatest of Ulster’s heroes, Cúchulainn, held off Medb’s encroaching armies, for he was not born of Ulster blood and was therefore exempt from Macha’s curse. Other stories in the Ulster Cycle include the tragic tale of Deirdre and the Sons Of Uisneach, the story of Nessa the raped maiden, and of Dechtire the miraculous mother.

Úna (Oona, Oonagh, Nuala). Irish heroine.

Uncumber (Liberata, Livrade, Wilgefortis, Saint Uncumber). British folkloric figure. It is possible that the Saint of this name disguises an ancient goddess of the region around Burton, in Sussex, where Uncumber is still honored. She has strange duties for a Christian saint, for Uncumber was charged with freeing wives from the encumbrance of their husbands. Once called Wilgefortis, Uncumber was a pagan princess of southern France who, threatened by her father with an unwanted marriage, prayed to be made unattractive to men and woke up with a beard.

Undry (Uinde). Irish symbolic object. This name is sometimes given to the great Cauldron of the beneficent god Dagda, which fed everyone who needed food and refused no hungry person.

Unseelie Court. British folkloric motif. The Fairies who screamed through the earth on their Wild Hunt are known by this name, which means “unseemly” or “unholy.” While some fairies, like Brownies, were helpful to human beings, the Trooping Fairies of the Unseelie Court were dangerous. Anyone who saw them was a potential victim for Fairy Kidnapping. Good fairies who danced and sang but did not kidnap mortals formed the Seelie Court.

Urban (Urban of the Black Thorn). Arthurian hero. This guardian figure stood at a River ford, protecting his land from invasion. Magical birds helped him: One, killed by Percival, was revealed to be an enchanted woman. He plays little part in Arthurian legend.

Urien. British mythological figure and Arthurian hero. In the works of the early mythographer and historian Nennius, we learn of four ancient warriors, one of them named Urien. With the others—Dhydderch, Gua-Ilaug and Morcant—Urien attacked the ruler Theodric, who held out against him for three days on the island of Lindisfarne before succumbing to their mightier force. In Arthurian legend, Urien was the king of Gore and husband of king Arthur’s half sister, the sorceress Morgan.

- "But the current shape has been carved over an earlier one, creating an awkward though womanly form. Whether the Venus of Quimpilly represents a remnant of an earlier local goddess cult or an imported divinity is unknown." Verbeia (Verbia). British goddess. One of the many River goddesses of Celtic lands, Verbeia was the resident spirit of the River Warfe, known from inscriptions at a Roman fort in Yorkshire. The name, which may mean "winding river" or "she of the cattle," may not be original, but a Latinized form of a Celtic name. Local legend has it that the river goddess appeared on Beltane morning, on May 1, in the form of a white Horse;
- "Anyone seeing the apparition should be wary of drowning in the river’s spring flood. Such threatening tales have been interpreted as indicating a folk memory of Human Sacrifice (see Peg Powler). Horses are not typical familiars of the Celtic river goddess, who is more likely to appear as a Cow, so the connection of the animal with Verbeia may indicate a confusion with the mare goddess Epona.6V 464. A sculpture found at Ilkley in Yorkshire shows the goddess holding two long snakes in her hands, possibly representing the watery waves of her river. Some scholars have seen evidence of a solar cult in Verbeia’s iconography, which includes Spirals and Wheels. Viereckschanzen (sing., Viereckschanze). Continental Celtic site. Across the Celtic regions of Europe, archaeologists have found these ritual enclosures, surrounded by a square or rectangular ditch. Some show evidence of timber buildings, presumably shrines or Temples, within them."
- "Burials too have been found on these sites, as well as the remains of what appear to have been animal offerings. Often there are indications of a well in the enclosure. Vindonnus (Vindonus) Continental Celtic god. The Romans equated this Healing god with their own Apollo."

- Vinotonus. "British god. This obscure god may have been connected with wine-making or grape-growing, for his name seems to include the syllable for 'wine,' vin-. A shrine dedicated to Vinotonus, found on the Yorkshire moors, points to his powers as a god of wild Nature, as does his identification by the Roman legionnaires with their wildwood god Silvanus."
