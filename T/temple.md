Structure of temple rituals among the Celts differed significantly from their conquerors, the Romans. They did not construct buildings specifically for religious worship, instead preferring to gather outdoors in sacred woods known as Nemetons, where they would make sacrifices and offerings. The Celts also congregated on hilltops, such as Uisneach and Tara, where they lit great fires on festival days. Inauguration ceremonies and other such rituals were conducted at holy wells. There is some archaeological evidence of buildings that have been referred to as temples or castles, which may have been used for both religious and assembly purposes. Maiden Castle in Dorset, a British site dating back to the first century B.C.E., contains evidence of a circular building with likely religious purpose, owing to the circle's cosmological importance to the Celts. Ireland's Emain Macha and Dún Ailinne also house remnants of circular buildings, with Emain Macha featuring indications of a central post that may have represented the central tree in a grove. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive indication that Celtic people regularly sought protection from nature's power during their religious practices.
