Welsh hero Trystan, also known as Drystan or Drystan fab Tallwch, is the protagonist in a Welsh-language version of the well-known tale of Tristan and Iseult. In this story, the hero and heroine are named Trystan and Esyllt, with Esyllt being the wife of king March ap Meirchion. Trystan and Esyllt eloped to a forest where they were besieged by March's three armies, leading to a bloody and brutal battle. When it seemed that Trystan might be victorious, king Arthur was called upon to mediate a truce. The wise king suggested that they share Esylltâ€™s affections, with one man having her in the summer and the other in the winter. March chose to have her in the winter, when nights were longest, but Trystan outwitted him by claiming that as yew trees are green year-round, he should keep Esyllt forever. Some scholars believe that Trystan's character may have originated from the lore of the Picts, a distinct northern British people of unknown cultural background.
