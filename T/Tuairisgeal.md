Encountered by the king of Ireland during his travels in Scotland, Tuairisgeal, a Scottish folklore figure, swindled the king into gambling. Losing his wife and horse to Tuairisgeal in successive rounds, the king of Ireland was surprised to find himself victorious in the third. Tuairisgeal then requested a most unlikely reward for his victory - an explanation of how his father had died. The Irish king had no answer, so he left to find out, riding Tuairisgeal's horse and accompanied by his wife. Their journey brought them all the way to the court of Greece, where they discovered that Tuairisgealâ€™s father was a monstrous being who had transformed children into wolves. The king of Greece lost several offspring to the beast, and it was only when he confronted it, after one of his daughters was imperiled by a monstrous claw, that the monster was vanquished. The wolfish children were then restored to human form. The king of Ireland had the unenviable task of relaying this news to the enigmatic gambling stranger.
