Welsh heroine Tegau Eurfron is recognized as one of the Three Splendid Women of Camelot. She once rescued her husband from a venomous snake, but suffered a bite herself, resulting in her losing one breast. However, a new breast made of gold was crafted and adjoined to her body, perfectly matching her golden hair.
