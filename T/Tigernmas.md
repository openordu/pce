Irish hero, Tigernmas (Tiernmas), has been known for his association with the merciless god Crom Cruach. He was also responsible for the introduction of the gold-smelting process in Ireland, which has remained a significant industry since ancient times. Tigernmas, who was a semi-historical king of Tara, left a remarkable legacy through these contributions.
