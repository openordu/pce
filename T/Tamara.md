In Devon and Cornwall folklore, Tamara Cornish is a notable figure. The nymph of River Tamar, which created the boundary between Cornwall and Devon, was at first a maiden who wandered around freely, much to the annoyance of her parents who were two earth-dwelling Gnomes. She caught the attention of two Giants, Torridge and Tavy, who ended up fighting over her. The lovers dissolved into the rivers that now bear their names. This legend, recorded in the 17th century, likely expanded upon an older tale since the ancient geographer Ptolemy referred to Tamar as a major river of the region. The story of Tamara shows similarity to those of other Celtic river goddesses such as Bóand and Sínann, but stands out for how it depicts male divine beings dissolving to create rivers.
