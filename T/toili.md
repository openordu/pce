A Welsh figure of folklore is known as the toili. This figure is seen at night, where it appears as a funeral procession passing through a village. The villagers appear to be slowly following a casket, heading towards the cemetery. In reality, however, the villagers are tucked away safely in their own homes. The toili is a ghostly funeral procession that may also be seen during the day by those with Second Sight. Its presence is an ominous sign that someone's death is about to occur. It is crucial to avoid the toili if seen since those who are caught in its procession will not survive.
