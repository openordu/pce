Irish mythology presents the Three Sorrows of Ireland, a trilogy of tales considered to be some of the most poignant. These tales are Deirdre of the Sorrows and her lover Noísiu, and Noísiu's brothers, known as the Sons Of Uisneach; the Sons Of Tuireann, a story of slaughter; and Fionnuala, a brave girl, and her brothers, called the Children Of Lir.
