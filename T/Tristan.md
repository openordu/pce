Tristan was a remarkable hero in Cornish history. His legendary love story with Iseult has become one of the most celebrated romances in the Celtic world. He was not only a fierce warrior but also an accomplished artist, known for his exceptional musicianship and storytelling skills. Furthermore, he was strikingly handsome, which made him the object of many maidens’ affections. Nevertheless, fate had intended him to love and be loved by his king’s wife. Tristan’s uncle, Mark of Cornwall (sometimes called Cornouille in Brittany), was enchanted by a single strand of the most exquisite gold hair and was determined to marry the woman to whom it belonged. Iseult, the owner of the hair, was the woman in question, and Tristan was tasked with escorting her from Ireland to Cornwall for her wedding. During the journey, Iseult and Tristan were presented with a potion by Iseult’s handmaid, Brangien, to quench their thirst. This drink, however, was not an ordinary one, but a magical concoction sourced from Iseult’s mother. In an attempt to guarantee her daughter’s happiness, she had prepared a potion for her wedding night. Unable to resist the drink's effects, Iseult fell madly in love with the handsome knight, Tristan. Despite their devotion to King Mark, Tristan and Iseult eventually consummated their love before Iseult returned to her husband. Tristan was heartbroken, and unable to bear the pain, he married a woman with the same name as his beloved. Nonetheless, he could not bring himself to sleep with her. When he heard the news of Iseult’s alleged death, he died of heartbreak himself. A romantic tale for a long time, the story has its roots in the mythology of the goddess of Sovereignty, who selects as her partner, the most virile and robust lover. We can find a similar story in different versions across the Celtic regions such as in the tale of king Arthur, queen Guinevere, and her knight Lancelot in Britain or in the Irish mythology of the aging hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill, the splendid Gráinne, and the attractive Diarmait.
