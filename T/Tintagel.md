Tintagel is a prominent location in Cornish mythology, featuring a Norman castle situated on a steep outcrop overlooking the Irish Sea. The site has been linked to the conception of King Arthur by his father, Uther Pendragon, upon his mother Igraine, although there are alternative sites that lay claim to this distinction. The castle was established during the 12th century, although there is evidence of occupation at the location up to seven hundred years earlier. Additionally, the area was famous in ancient times for its exportation of tin. Within close proximity to the castle, there is a small depression in the rock known as King Arthur's Footprint, believed to be an Inauguration Stone.
