A Cornish folkloric site known as Trewa existed. Witches used to gather at this location near Zennor during their Midsummer celebration. They would ignite fires on the Burn Downs, dance, cast spells and engage in other forms of magic and mischief. The festival's focal point was a peculiar rock formation called Witches' Rock. As per local superstition, the rock guaranteed protection against misfortune if one touched it nine times as the clock struck midnight.
