A deity of the Continental Celtic, Tarvostrigaranus (Tarvos Trigaranus) is recognized from two sculptures made of stone located at Paris and Trier. These portray him as a Bull carrying Three Cranes or some other kind of waterbirds on him. Although it is unclear, he might be similar to or the same as the god Esus.
