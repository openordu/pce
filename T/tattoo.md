Celtic ritual may have included tattoos. The word “tattoo” originates from the South Pacific, but there is evidence to suggest that the Celts permanently adorned their body with markings. The Scoti tribe, also known as the “scarred ones,” and the Picts, also known as the “pictured ones” or the “engraved ones,” may have been tattooed. Celtic warriors were said to be painted with the blue coloring of the woad plant. In addition, coins from the imperial era depict faces with what appear to be tattoos. It is uncertain whether these tattoos represented status, totems, or religious symbols.
