Tine Ghealáin, which translates to Jack-o-Lantern or Jack of the Lantern, is a well-known figure in Irish folklore. Known elsewhere as the will-o’-the-wisp, a mysterious light observed over bogs during the night, it was believed in Ireland to be a lantern held by a deceased gambler cursed to wander eternally. The gambler had managed to win against the Devil in a card game, allowing him to escape hell despite his sinful soul preventing him from entering heaven. These events caused him to be associated with the hollowed-out turnips, and later pumpkins in the New World, used as lights during Samhain when the veils between worlds were thought to be thin.
