A cosmological concept referred to as totem is used by scholars to represent an animal or plant that was considered as an Ancestor or ancestral mother of a tribe. As a result of this association, the members of the tribe were prohibited from consuming or taking the life of their once related entity. Certain folk beliefs purportedly reveal remnants of this belief system, such as the lineage of certain coastal Irish families from Seal women. Moreover, mythological stories like that of King Conaire, who was forbidden to take the life of birds due to his ancestral connection to them, indicate the existence of such a belief system.
