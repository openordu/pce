Continental Celtic deity, Teutates (also known as Toutatis, Totatis, Teutate), is believed to be the god of the people, derived from the Celtic term for "tribe," which suggests that he may have been an ancestral god. Teutates was primarily worshiped in Gaul, occasionally in Britain, but never in Ireland. He's often associated with the god Cocidius or even considered to be an alternate form of him. According to the Romans, this divinity resembles their god of commerce, Mercury, and their warrior god, Mars. Lucan, a Roman author, claimed that Teutates received Human Sacrifice during which victims were drowned on Samhain, the feast of winter's commencement on November 1.
