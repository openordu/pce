The motif of Thirteen Treasures of Britain is prominent in British folklore. Similar to how Ireland's four great treasures symbolized the Sovereignty of the land, thirteen objects of Otherworldly origin, residing in our world, serve as indications of the rightful ruler, as per British legend. The renowned king Arthur brought them from Annwn – an Otherworld kingdom. These treasures include Rhydderech's flaming sword, which ignites when held by a rightful king; Gwyddno's bottomless hamper; Bran The Blessed's mead-dispensing horn; an incredibly swift chariot; a Horse-attracting halter; a knife that replenishes the food it cuts; a Cauldron that refuses to cook for cowards; a whetstone that sharpens the weapons of the brave alone; a coat fitting solely the noblest warriors; a crock, and a dish catering whatever the hungry desire; a self-playing chessboard; and the mantle of invisibility.
