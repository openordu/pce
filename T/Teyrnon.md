A hero from Wales named Teyrnon is mentioned in the tale of Rhiannon and her son Pryderi. This character served as Pryderi's foster father and saved him from being consumed by a monster. During Beltane night, Teyrnon witnessed a massive claw descending from the sky and targeting a newborn foal. Instantly, he leaped to its aid, slicing at the claw until it released its captive: the abducted child who Teyrnon and his wife then raised as their own.
