The Celts possessed a cosmological concept in which the reality they lived in was not uniform. They perceived that in certain places, known as “thin places,” the Otherworld was close by. The Otherworld was believed to be a realm of fairies and magical beings that existed parallel to the physical world. These thin places included lone Fairy Trees that grew amidst rock fields, treacherous Bogs where people could easily become lost and drown, and fluctuating Islands that could either appear remote or near depending on atmospheric conditions. In addition to thin places, there were also “thin times” during the year where Otherworld forces could penetrate into their world or humans could venture into the Otherworld. Although every day possessed a thin time at twilight, there were two specific days that were particularly thin when the two worlds collided: Beltane on May 1 and Samhain on November 1, the two Celtic feasts. The concept of thinness in regards to time and place was linked to the belief in Shape-Shifting, the skill of being able to transform one’s physical form into that of an animal, a plant, or even a fog.
