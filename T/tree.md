The Celts regarded trees not just as huge woody plants, but as religious symbols, symbolizing deep concepts. Trees represented wisdom, as they occupy different levels of reality, with roots unseen in the dark underground and branches soaring up to the sky. The Irish and Welsh words for tree (fid and gwydd) are related to the words for wisdom or those that are wise (fios and gywddon). Ancient writers recorded the sacredness of trees. Tacitus, for instance, described the dark groves of Anglesey, where the Druid orders made their last failed stand against the invading Romans. Other writers described Celtic Nemetons or sacred groves, where trees were drenched in human sacrifice. Although this might have been anti-Celtic propaganda, it seems that shrines were built around a significant central post in Germany, at Goloring and Goldberg, thought to represent a sacred tree. The same style of building was also discovered in Ireland, at the great capital of Ulster called Emain Macha. Additionally, Jupiter columns carved of stone in the shape of trees were found in some areas of Roman Gaul, thought to have been originally made of wood. People saw themselves as descending from trees, as many tribal names on the Continent suggest: the Eburones from Yews, the Lemovices from Elms. Tree names were also used for individuals, such as Guidgen (son of wood) and Guerngen (son of alder). In Irish mythology, we can find references to figures with tree names, such as Mac Cuilen (son of holly) and Mac Ibar (son of yew). The various names for Irish trees suggest that their upright and grand appearance was seen as comparable to that of human beings, so much so that they were thought to have family structures. In Irish history, the trees were revered, and there were records of individual trees that have become historical landmarks. According to legend in Ireland, Five magical trees existed, and they were especially revered. These were the Tree of Ross, which was a yew that produced fruits continually and was said to be a seed of a tree found in the biblical garden of Eden, the Tree of Mugna, which was an Oak tree that produced 900 bushels of acorns annually, and also the same quantity of apples and nuts every year. The Tree of Tortu, which was an Ash tree, was incredibly enormous that when it fell, it stretched across the island, and the Tree of Dathi, which was named after a poet it had killed when it fell. Additionally, the many-branched tree of Uisneach, located on the sacred mountain situated in Ireland's center, was also considered magical. These outstanding trees were all grown from the berries that fell from a branch carried by Trefuilngig Tre-eochair, an enigmatic mythological figure, as he passed over the Island. Medieval Irish Brehon laws, named after the druidical judges who formulated them, applied the same treatment to trees and people. The laws divided trees into various classifications or classes, with seven of them referred to as the "Noble trees." Fines or Érics had to be paid if any of these noble trees were cut down or harmed, including Oak, Holly, Hazel, apple, Birch, Alder, and Willow. Other trees, like the Elm, Hawthorn, Aspen, and Quicken, had lesser value in the legal system and were classified as peasant trees, while the shrubs, including Blackthorn, Elder, Spindle, Test-tree, Honeysuckle, Bird-cherry, and White Hazel, and the herbs like Gorse, Heather, Broom, Bog-myrtle, and Rushes, were also less valuable. The oak was the most revered tree for the druids who also believed in the magical power of Mistletoe that grows on this species. The Celts maintained their belief in the sacredness of trees even through Christian times, with continued alerts by Christian clergy and rulers against the worship of trees. The archbishop of Canterbury in the seventh century prohibited people from going to trees or wells, or making vows, or releasing themselves from them, declaring that they should only go to God’s church. If trees, ancient stones, or holy wells were not being used as places of prayer and appeal, there would have been no reason to warn against tree worship. Three hundred years later, King Edgar enforced that "every priest zealously promote Christianity and totally extinguish heathenism; and forbid well-worshiping and necromancies, divinations, worship with various trees and stones." The practice of offering coins to sacred trees, such as the Bile in Ireland, at holy wells persists, though discouraged as pounding metal into the bark has killed sacred trees before.

This alphabet has been the source of some controversy, with some scholars dismissing its importance, while others stress it. It was not used as our alphabet is, as a means of transcribing literary works and other compositions for later reading, but rather as a divinatory tool and as a means of memorizing.
