A Scottish folkloric figure known as the tangie was said to appear in and around water, whether fresh or salt, on the Orkney islands. His appearance would vary, sometimes resembling a human being, while at other times appearing as a fierce Water Horse. The tangie's name may be linked to the local term for seaweed, tang.
