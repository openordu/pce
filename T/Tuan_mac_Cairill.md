Tuan mac Cairill, an Irish hero and brother of the early Irish invader Parthol√≥n, is believed to have survived the plague that wiped out his people and continued to live on in various forms. These forms included that of a Stag, a Boar and an Eagle which he assumed after each reincarnation. Later, Tuan turned into a Salmon that got eaten up by a woman, who then became pregnant (refer to Pregnancy Through Drinking, Eating). Tuan was then reborn as a human and remarkably remembered all his past lives. This ability earned him the reputation of being a great and eloquent Bard. In Wales, a similar story was narrated about a boy named Gwion, who was reborn as the bard Taliesin after getting eaten by the goddess Ceridwen while Shape-Shifting. Tuan was the one who recounted the mythological history of Ireland known as the Book Of Invasions. He bore the authority to do so as he had witnessed a significant part of Irish history. Certain texts speculate that Tuan and Fintan, the salmon of Wisdom, were the same.
