A large, long Hillfort situated on a farm in Co. Meath, near the River Blackwater, is a nondescript Irish mythological site today. However, in ancient times, it was one of the most renowned sites in the land where the king of royal Tara presided over the annual games in honor of the goddess Tailtiu. The site gave its name to Tailtiu and even today to the townland surrounding it. These games were known as Ã“enach Tailten and were part of the harvest assembly celebrated on the Celtic feast of Lughnasa. The feast was named after Tailtiu's foster son, the god Lugh, who established the games and the assembly in her honor after Tailtiu died from exhaustion when she cleared Ireland's central pasturelands. Teltown was famous not only for the games and trading but also for the Teltown marriages, trial marriages contracted at a mound located across the road from the primary center of activity. The Crockans, a wooden door pierced by a hole, stood at that spot where young couples held hands while plighting their troth. If the match were not successful within a year and a day, they could return to the Crockans and undo the union. The games continued through medieval times, and the assembly was held until the 19th century. The long continuity of Teltown goes back even further. The site may have been selected because it was already sacred to the pre-Celtic people, and one of the earthworks at Teltown, the Rath Dubh ("black rath"), may be built above a Passage Grave.
