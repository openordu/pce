Manx folklore tells of a curious character known as the tarroo-ushtey. This Water Bull of the Isle of Man was, surprisingly, less harmful than other water monsters typically are. Instead of devouring people and cattle as they tend to do in other countries, the tarroo-ushtey's impact was limited to damaging crops. Like many other entities of fairy lore, the Water Bull could be repelled with a Rowan wand.
