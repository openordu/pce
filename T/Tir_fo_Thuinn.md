Irish mythology holds a site called Tir fo Thuinn (also known as Tir-fa-Tonn, which means Land Under Wave). This location is one of many names that refer to the Otherworld or Fairyland. The naming of Land Under Wave is based on the belief that lakes and oceans conceal the passage between our world and the Otherworld. The tales of cities that lay below lakes or on the ocean floor, as well as those of Mermaids and Mermen who inhabit them, are widespread in all Celtic lands along the coast.
