At a young age of 15, Tuag caught the attention of Manannán Mac Lir, the god of the sea, despite being raised on the royal hill of Tara by the high king Conaire himself. Given this, Conaire declared that Tuag's home should remain free from any man. However, several nobles and kings tried to pursue her and court her hand, but it was Manannán who was determined to make her his wife. Thus, he sent his Bard Fer Í as his messenger for the purpose. Disguised as a woman, Fer Í entered Tuag's chambers and sang a very powerful lullaby to make her fall into a deep sleep. Whilst singing to her, he carried her and brought her away. Unfortunately, Fer Í's decision to rest and pick a poor location for it led to Tuag being carried away by the rising waters of the Bann River and subsequently drowning. Several other goddesses like Bóand and Sínann have similar stories attributed to them, making Tuag a possible goddess of the Bann River. Her name is now carried by Tuag Inber, the river's estuary that bears the name of the place where three great waves were said to strike the shores of Ireland; the waves of Rudraighe, the Fairy Queen Clídna and the one that lands upon Tuag Inber.
