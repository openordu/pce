Welsh deity Tegid Voel, also spelled as Tegid Foel or Tegyd FoÃ«l, is a rather mysterious figure, often overshadowed by his partner, the renowned Hag goddess Ceridwen. Although it is known that he was her companion, not much else has been recorded about him apart from the fact that the lake which served as their dwelling - currently known as Lake Bala - was named after him.
