Thomas Learmont, known by various names such as True Thomas, Thomas Rymour, and Thomas of Ercildoune, was a celebrated British hero. He was a poet who lived in the 13th century and was famous for his encounter with the Fairy Lover - a creature filled with lust - during his visit to Fairyland. The Fairy Lover abducted him and held him captive for a period of seven years. However, when it became evident that the Devil was planning to take Thomas away to offset his mistress's old debt, the fairy queen released him back to his human world. As a parting gift, the queen granted him the ability to prophesy without the option to deceive. This caused him a great deal of trouble when he returned to the earth's realm. In some variations of the tale, Thomas returned to Fairyland towards the end of his life, where he was spotted by other visitors, happily by the side of his Fairy mistress.
