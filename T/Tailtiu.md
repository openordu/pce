Tailtiu, also known as Taillte or Tailtu, is a goddess from Ireland whose mythological story is paralleled by the historical reality of waves of invaders landing in the country. The two groups at the boundary of which Tailtiu stands are the Fir Bolg and the Tuatha Dé Danann, with some modern scholars considering her a goddess transformed into human form. While she may have been a Fir Bolg member or even a Spanish princess, Tailtiu was married to the last king of the Fir Bolg, Eochaid mac Eirc, who was an exemplary ruler that brought abundant crops and truth-speaking land. Eochaid died when the Fir Bolg battled the Tuatha Dé Danann, and Tailtiu then married Eochaid Garbh from the latter group. Tailtiu then traveled to the island's center, where she cleared fields for planting, but died from the effort of felling the dense Irish forest. Before her death, she requested that her funeral continues forever, accompanied by festivities and horse racing. Thus, her foster son, the god Lugh, established the August festival named Lughnasa at Teltown, where the River Blackwater is located. At Meath, a magnificent meeting of different tribes was organized, known as the Óenach. The purpose of this event was multi-faceted, ranging from commercial activities to matchmaking, and was also a time of celebration. Ritualistic athletic contests were held, which were appropriate for that particular season. There have been several legends that suggest horse-racing was one of the activities during this festival such as tales of teams swimming across nearby rivers at the break of dawn. During medieval times, the Great Games in Teltown (also known as the Tailtian Games) were held to honor Tailtiu, while the same location hosted smaller festivals until the 19th century. The Óenach Tailten held most significance among the old Irish festivals. This was primarily because it took place nearest to the hill of Tara - the center of political power, and sponsored by its kings. Other Lughnasa festivals such as Carman, Tlachtga, were dedicated to goddesses representing dying vegetation, as they were earth goddesses that fed humanity.
