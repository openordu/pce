The ancient Irish practice known as teinm laeda, also spelled tienm laído, was a sort of divination that bears striking resemblance to contemporary psychometry. This method involved acquiring information from objects through touch, where a verse or incantation may have been recited along with a wand, often made from hazel or other enchanted trees, being used to touch the object in question. As per legend, receiving information directly was a potential outcome as well, for instance, by simply holding a bone, the Bard Moén mac Etnae could determine the name of a long-deceased dog. Fionn Mac Cumhaill, the hero, was also believed to have prophesied by chewing on his thumb. St. Patrick, however, banned the use of teinm laeda, along with the better-known Imbas Forosnai, because both techniques required sacrifices, or prayers, to pagan gods and goddesses.
