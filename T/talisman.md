Symbolic objects known as talismans are often used interchangeably with amulets, even though the two terms are not necessarily distinct. These magical objects serve different purposes, where a talisman is believed to attract good fortune or divine blessings to its owner, while an amulet is meant to protect against malevolent spirits and misfortune.
