A Scottish ritual named taghairm is described in Scottish texts whereby conjurers roast live cats over coals until a giant cat named Big-Ears appears. This ritual may be linked to the ancient king of the cats, known in Ireland as Irusan. Despite being known until the 17th century, the clergy discouraged the practice of taghairm, declaring that those who performed it would be instantly condemned to hell.
