A Cornish folkloric character called Tavy is said to have been a river spirit who once competed with another Giant named Torridge for the affections of Tamara, a beautiful maiden. In the end, Tavy emerged victorious, and the three of them turned into rivers, with only Tavy joining the Tamar while Torridge flowed somewhere else. It has been proposed that the name Tavy might have given rise to the name of the sea spirit Davy Jones.
