The Celtic leadership structure included a role known as the tanist or tan√°iste, as noted by several ancient and medieval writers. In the 17th century, even the English poet Edmund Spenser  acknowledged that the Irish continued to elect their kings and their tanist, who would step up as leader after the king's death. The tanist was chosen based on abilities and strength, not necessarily on family position or reputation, as was also the case with the king. It is suggested by some scholars that the tanist position may have had a religious significance as well as a political one, potentially linking to Celtic beliefs in the power of twins.
