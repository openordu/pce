In southwestern England, close to the small town of Glastonbury, there is a peculiar pyramidal hill known as the Tor. It was widely recognized as an entryway to a different realm and the abode of Fairyland's king named Gwynn Ap Nudd. Celtic saint Collen came across the Fairies and their monarch on the peak of the hill. There, he witnessed a splendid palace overcrowded with dancing figures. When enquired about his opinion on the scene, Collen responded by splashing holy water at the palace, causing everything to disappear instantly. Many believe that Glastonbury was, in fact, the Avalon itself, where the great Lady of the Lake performed her deeds and brought Arthur to. The hilltop is adorned with a tower dedicated to St. Michael, who, though being a Christian figure, could have been absorbed into an earlier god or hero. On the tower, one can find a carving of Brigit milking a cow, which is also present at other Glastonbury sites. The tower is in close proximity to an Iron Age settlement, indicating that people had lived there for over two millennia. Two Wells run beneath the Tor - Chalice Well or Blood Spring, which appears red as blood due to its iron-stained water, and White Spring, whose water lacks any such tincture. This arrangement of twin wells with differently colored water could have certainly been the reason why the site carried great significance for the ancient inhabitants. In Arthurian legend, a figure named Pellinore is known to have been born as a commoner but was eager to become a knight of the Round Table. After realizing his goal, he was then revealed as the legitimate son of King Pellinore.
