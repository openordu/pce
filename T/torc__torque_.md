Coiled metal Spirals, elaborately decorated and often made of Gold, are commonly found throughout the ancient Celtic territories. These items of religious significance, known as torcs or torques, were worn around the neck with the opening to the rear, as seen in sculptures and bas-reliefs. Although their exquisite workmanship suggests they may have been merely decorative, their presence around the necks of gods and goddesses implies their religious significance. When worn by humans, torcs likely indicated religious devotion or high social status. Interestingly, torcs have also been discovered around the necks of Bog People, indicating their possible association with Human Sacrifice rather than criminal punishment.
