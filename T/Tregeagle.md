A figure of Cornish folklore, most commonly known as Tregeagle, was said to have lived in Cornwall. According to legend, he was an evil man who murdered his wife and sold his soul to the Devil. Despite attempting to outsmart his fate, he was so selfish that he refused to leave Earth after his death and instead caused trouble for his neighbors who wished to use his land. Eventually, a local clergyman tasked him with the seemingly impossible feat of emptying a pool using only a shell. Tregeagle fulfilled this task until he became exhausted and took a break, at which point the Devil appeared and took him away, leaving him to howl in agony, and giving rise to the popular Cornish saying "roaring like Tregeagle."
