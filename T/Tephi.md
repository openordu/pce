An Irish heroine named Tephi is mentioned in the Dindshenchas, a type of place-poetry. According to this text, she was involved in the foundation of the ramparts of Tara, which were named after her. The text describes Tephi as a fierce warrior and an Egyptian pharaohâ€™s daughter who was taken by Camson, a champion whose identity is not specified. Tephi used her staff and brooch to create the outlines of the earthen walls, and after her death in Ireland, she was possibly buried in Spain. The story of Tephi is similar to that of Macha, who used the pin of her brooch to outline the raths of the capital of Ulster. The relationship between these stories is unclear, as it is not clear whether Tephi inspired Macha or vice versa.
