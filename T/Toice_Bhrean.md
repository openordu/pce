At the enchanted Lough Gur in Irish folklore, there exists a figure named Toice Bhrean who is believed to be the Fairy Housekeeper. In local legends, it is said that she sits at the bottom of the lake, constantly knitting. The name Toice Bhrean means “lazybones” or “slattern” and is tied to the story of how the lake was formed. According to the tale, the guardian responsible for a sacred well left the lid open, causing it to overflow and form the lake, much like Lough Neagh. As punishment for her carelessness, Toice Bhrean was condemned to spend eternity at the bottom of the lake under a magical tree. On only one occasion every seven years, she is said to see the light of day when the lake’s waters evaporate briefly.
