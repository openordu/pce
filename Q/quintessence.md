Cosmic concept of quintessence, originating from the Latin term for 'Five' and implying a concentrated essence, refers to the mystical center or Mide. It is a place that is both omnipresent and non-existent, a pivotal point around which the world revolves. Though Mide was one of the five Provinces of ancient Ireland, it was not constrained to any one place until the medieval era; earlier, it had been an ever-shifting boundless area. Uisneach and Tara are some of the locations associated with it. (Word count: 55)
