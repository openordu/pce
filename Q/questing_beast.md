Monstrous in nature, the questing beast, also known as Beast Glatisant, is a legendary figure in Arthurian mythology, frequently mentioned in tales. It appeared to be a strange amalgamation of Serpent, Deer, and Leopard, but with just four legs. Uniquely, whenever the beast ran, the sound of thirty hooves could be heard. A knight who is sometimes identified as Pellinore or Palomides chased it ceaselessly. However, there may be more to the story. Some tales suggest that the beast was, in fact, a human boy who had undergone a transformation into an animal form after witnessing his mother being torn apart by wild dogs, thus leading him to be pursued relentlessly.
