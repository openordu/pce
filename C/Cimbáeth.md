Three Ulster kings, namely Cimbáeth, Áed Ruad, and Díthorba, formed an agreement that the kingship would alternate among them every seven years. The pact was successfully enforced by a collective of poets, nobles, and Druids until Áed Ruad's life was taken. After his death, the position was to be held by his daughter, Macha Mong Rua, but Cimbáeth and Díthorba opposed her claim and engaged in a battle. Macha Mong Rua triumphed over the two kings, ascended the throne, and married Cimbáeth. Díthorba, on the other hand, was slain by the new queen.
