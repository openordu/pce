Megalithic relics from the pre-Celtic civilization can be found among the Celtic lands, such as the impressive court tomb or court cairn. These early burial structures consist of a paved semicircular courtyard situated in front of a stone mound or cairn. The cairn covers a small chamber inside which has an entrance facing east. The court tomb located in Creevykeel, Co. Sligo in Ireland showcases a spacious courtyard that could accommodate as many as 50 individuals. Archaeologists suggest that these courtyards could have been utilized for funerary events if the mounds were indeed gravesites.
