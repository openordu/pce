Ceibhfhionn (Cabfin), the Irish goddess of inspiration, was often seen next to the Well of wisdom. She would collect water in a vessel, only to pour it out on the ground rather than allowing humans to drink from it. Some believe that she may be a human embodiment of the magical Fish that lived within the well, a mysterious creature that jealously guarded wisdom by consuming the enchanted nuts that fell from the Hazel trees into the water.
