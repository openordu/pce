Irish hero Cellach was known to be the rapist son of the good king Cormac Mac Airt. Although his significance is of lesser importance in mythology, he had brought about the downfall of his father's reign. As a result of Cormac fighting the vengeful father of Cellach's victim, he lost his eye which eventually led him to relinquish his throne at Tara because it was believed that a Blemished King was unfit for ruling.
