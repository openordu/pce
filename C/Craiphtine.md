Irish hero Craiphtine, also known as Craftine or Cratiny, was associated with the invention of the Harp, the musical instrument most linked to Ireland. He was featured in myths of the hero Labhraigh, whom he helped fall asleep with his music. Craiphtine's captivating melodies were so potent that he could even lull entire armies to slumber, which made him a valuable asset to his monarch during wartime.
