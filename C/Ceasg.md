In Scottish folklore, there exists a mythological creature known as the Ceasg. This being is a Highland Mermaid, who is said to be half woman and half salmon. She is also sometimes referred to as “maighdean na tuinne” which translates to "maiden of the wave." According to legend, sea captains were often born from the union of a human and a Ceasg. Those who captured the creature were said to be granted wishes, but the Ceasg also had a darker side. Similar to other sirens of the sea, she was known to capture humans who dared to enter her underwater domain. Sadly, many who were caught by the Ceasg would lose their lives.
