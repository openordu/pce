The Celts are known for being early horse domesticators and charioteers. Highly regarded people such as gods, goddesses, heroes and heroines are depicted in written and artistic form as charioteers, accompanied by chariot parts like the bridle and wheel, which appear in iconography. Charms, which are incantations meant to attract good fortune and ward off bad luck, are opposed to curses. For instance, in Scotland there exists a "charm against the evil eye" which involves taking water from beneath a protective bridge and sprinkling it around the household. There are many examples of charms in Celtic lands, some involving certain ritual gestures, specific offerings, the gathering of herbs, or incantations. Churning milk maids would sing a charm to hasten the butter during their monotonous work. The labor of making linen could also be eased by waulking charms. In Scotland, a milking charm was passed down that called on various saints with each flow of milk. Many ancient Christianized charms persisted in use well into recent years. Ireland had a few charms as well, such as stealing a dead hand from a corpse or the liver of a black cat. The former was effective in butter churning and the latter dried into a love potion. A custom prevailed in Cornwall where individuals wrote charms on pieces of paper and kept them in their pockets and purses. Among these charms was one that featured a picture of a four-winged bird with the untranslatable word nalgah inscribed on it.
