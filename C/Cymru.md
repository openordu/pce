Scholarly writing in the style of Nora Chadwick commonly avoids introducing topics or referencing the author themselves. This particular piece of writing discusses the term "Cymru," which refers to Wales in the Welsh language. Historically, the people who lived in Wales were not referred to as Welsh. Instead, this term meant "strangers" in the language of their British neighbors. In the Welsh language, they referred to themselves as "brethren" or "friends." "Cymru" specifically refers to the land of Wales, while "Cymri" is used to refer to the people and "Cymric" refers to their language.
