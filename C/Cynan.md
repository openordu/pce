Welsh hero Cynan, brother-in-law of the quasi-historical ruler Maxen, assisted Maxen in gaining the position of western Roman emperor. In exchange for his service, Cynan was granted control over Brittany, where he ensured linguistic dominance of the Welsh language among his warriors by disallowing potential competitors through the brutal act of cutting out the tongues of local women. Cynan's existence likely stems more from political motives than religious worship, suggesting his character to be fictitious, akin to that of Maxen's.
