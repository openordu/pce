Cnabetius is a Continental Celtic deity who is referred to as “the crippled one.” Though not much is known about this god, inscriptions have been discovered in Celtic areas of Austria and Germany. Scholars have associated him with injured royalty like the Irish Nuada, while the Romans drew comparisons between Cnabetius and their protective war god, Mars.
