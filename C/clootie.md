Clootie is a ritual object used in Ireland and Scotland. It is a piece of cloth, ribbon or rag that is tied to an honored site, such as a sacred tree or bile growing near a holy well. The practice involves touching the rag to a body part in need of healing before tying it to the tree. This tradition has continued to the present day. There is a tree beside a well in Scotland surrounded by tens of thousands of ribbons tied to the surrounding trees and shrubs.
