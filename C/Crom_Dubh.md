The Irish deity or hero Crom Dubh appears in tales of St. Patrick. According to legend, Crom Dubh was a pagan king who became irate when St. Patrick failed to properly express gratitude for Three Bulls: the saint merely thanked God upon receiving each one. However, when Patrick wrote his words on three slips of paper and had their weight measured against the bulls, they were found to be identical. As a result, Crom Dubh was immediately converted to Christianity. Crom Dubh’s name is still used as the name of the yearly celebration at Croagh Patrick in Co. Mayo. In some stories, Patrick’s adversary is referred to as Crom Cruach, which implies that the “king” was a humanized form of an ancient god.
