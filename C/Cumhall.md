Irish hero Cumhall (Camall, Camhall) is widely known as the father of the great hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. He fathered Fionn upon the unwilling Murna, whom he abducted from her father Tadg mac Nuadat. This caused enmity between his family, the Clan Baíscne, and hers, the Clan Morna. It is not clear how Cumhall died, as legends of his death vary. However, according to popular belief, he was killed by Conn of the Hundred Battles, who was king of Tara and Tadg’s ally.
