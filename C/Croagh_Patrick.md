In Co. Mayo, in the west of Ireland, a striking triangular mountain ascends from the sea level to 2,500 feet. This mountain, called Croagh Patrick, has been viewed as sacred for thousands of years. It was formerly known as Cruachan Aigle in honor of Aigle who died there while carrying boulders in his pockets up its slopes. Neolithic ruins have been found on its summit, indicating its religious significance since the pre-Celtic period. It is also famously known as the place where St. Patrick Christianized Ireland by fasting for forty days and forty nights in emulation of Christ’s desert exile, battling with the force of pagan Ireland, and ultimately emerging as the victor over Corra, a demon who drowned in the lake at the base of the peak. Despite St. Patrick's victory, ancient pagan festivals resurfaced with a new Christian appeal, including the Lughnasa harvest festival that was rebranded as The Reek, a Christian pilgrimage where devotees climb Croagh Patrick on the last Sunday of July. As many as 60,000 pilgrims, including Princess Grace (Kelly) of Monaco on one occasion, climb the mountain each year, some on their knees or barefoot. This custom of climbing hills on Lughnasa has been a routine practice in Celtic tradition. While the festival is Christian in nature, its local name, Domhnach Chrom Dubh, which means Crom Dubh’s Sunday, is a remnant of its ancient pagan roots, Crom Dubh was defeated by Patrick in his struggle to save Ireland from paganism.
