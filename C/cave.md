Symbolic site, the cave held a significant place in Celtic imagery, particularly as openings to the Otherworld. These portals were typically located in liminal zones such as bogs, swamps, and land surrounded by water or areas that connected different levels of the world, including caves and mountains. The cave and mountain were often considered in parallel; their connection was further strengthened when the natural caves were built near raths or hillforts. In Co. Roscommon, Ireland, the most mythologically important cave was Oweynagat or the Cave of the Cats, a natural underground passageway beneath Medb's rath at Cruachan. The great queen Mórrígan led her Otherworldly cattle through its small entrance, and inside, the great Cauldron of abundance, once kept at Tara but later returned to the Otherworld, lay. The cave, like other passages to the Otherworld, was particularly powerful during Samhain when spirits circulated around it. The Adventure of Nera and the famous Táin Bó Cuailnge, among other epics set at Cruachan, often began on Samhain.
