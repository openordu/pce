A notable female figure in Irish mythology is Clothra, who is either a heroine or a goddess. According to legend, Clothra was one of four daughters of the famous Irish king Eochaid Fedlech; the others were Medb, Eithne, and Mugain. She also had three sons who were all named Finn and collectively known as the Finn Emna. Clothra became pregnant and gave birth to a son named Lugaidh Riab nDerg, who had distinct red stripes on his body as a result of each part of his body being fathered by one of his three half-brothers. Subsequently, Clothra had a sexual relationship with her son Lugaidh and became pregnant again, this time with her most famous offspring named Crimthann Nia NÃ¡ir, who was born after Clothra's death. Her sister Medb was envious of Clothra and caused her death. Clothra's presence in various genealogies and the incestuous nature of her matings suggest that she might have been an ancestral goddess.
