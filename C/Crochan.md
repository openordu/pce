Crochan (Cruacha) is a figure from Irish mythology who is either a heroine or a goddess. When the queen of Tara, Étain, ran away, her pregnant servant gave birth to the great queen and goddess Medb in a Connacht cave named Oweynagat or the Cave of the Cats or Síd Sinche, which belongs to Sinech- an unknown person whose name means “large breasts”. Despite the cave appearing like a hole in the earth, Crochan considered the mystical site a beautiful Fairy palace and continued to live there even after her daughter had constructed a palace on a rath (Hillfort) and named it Cruachan in her honour. Crochan's name means “vessel” and she is sometimes referred to as Crochan Crocderg or Croderg, meaning “the blood-red cup".
