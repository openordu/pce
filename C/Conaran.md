Conaran is an enigmatic deity in Irish mythology who was the mother of three sorceress daughters. These daughters were filled with desire for the mighty warriors of the Fianna and wove a spellbinding web to trap them. Unfortunately, the heroes were successful in killing all three daughters, as can be found in the story of Irnan. It should be noted that Conaran is sometimes portrayed as a male character, specifically as a prince of the otherworldly Tuatha Dé Danann.
