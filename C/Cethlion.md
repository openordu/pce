A protagonist or goddess from Ireland, Cethlion (Cethlenn, Ceithlenn, Céthlionn, Caitlín, Kethlenda of the Crooked Teeth) was the buck-toothed queen of an archaic Irish community named the Fomorians, along with being the spouse of their leader Balor. As a prophetic being, Cethlion was aware of the downfall of her people against the invading Tuatha Dé Danann in the second battle of Mag Tuired. Despite her knowledge, she engaged in an intense fight during which she inflicted damage upon one of the leaders of her enemies, the Dagda.
