Scottish folklore tells of Casan Buidhe, also known as Yellow Legs or Weaver of the Yellow Legs. This well-known wizard would target unsuspecting travelers crossing rivers. Casan Buidhe had the ability to shape-shift into a large stag, causing fear and panic in those crossing the ford. This would often result in the individuals abandoning their treasures in their haste to escape or drowning in their fright, giving the wizard the opportunity to take their wealth. Eventually, a Smith, a mythical creature in its own right, confronted Casan Buidhe and ultimately defeated him.
