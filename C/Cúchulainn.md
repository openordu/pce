Irish legend boasts a mighty hero named Cúchulainn (also Cuhullin, Cú Chulainn, or Cuchullin) who has no equal in strength or renown, even though the great Fionn Mac Cumhaill comes close. The Ulster Cycle features Cúchulainn most prominently and tells the tale of his magical birth. When his mother, Dechtire, drank water with a worm in it, Cúchulainn was born. This same story of magical conception applies to Cúchulainn’s king, Concobar Mac Nessa, who is Cúchulainn’s mythic double. Concobar was either Dechtire’s father or brother, and rumors spread that Dechtire was pregnant with an incestuous child when she began to show. Dechtire married but was ashamed, causing Cúchulainn to be born prematurely. Nonetheless, he lived, bearing the name of Sétanta. All of Ireland’s heroes contended for the privilege of fostering the brilliant young man, which prompted Dechtire to request that each instead offer a special gift. As a result, Cúchulainn received the finest treasures that ancient Ireland had to offer: the poetry of Amairgin, the eloquence of Sencha, and the wealth of Blaí Briuga. The valiant Fergus Mac Róich served as his teacher in the manly arts, while kindhearted Findchóem nurtured him. Conall Cernach was his foster brother, and Concobar, his foster father. Variant narratives suggest that Cúchulainn was Sualtaim Mac Roich’s son, an Ulster chieftain otherwise unknown who typically fills the role of his foster father or that he was conceived by the god Lugh when Dechtire was in the enchanted form of a bird. In all of the tales, however, Cúchulainn reveals his warrior nature early on, challenging boys at the Emain Macha court when he was only five years old to a contest with child-size weapons, which he won easily. King Concobar ventured to Cuailnge, a place that would later prove to have a significant influence on the life of Cúchulainn, leaving behind the young Sétanta who was occupied with playing. Sétanta caught up with the royal party at Smith Culann's house, guarded by a ferocious dog that Cúchulainn killed with ease in order to enter. Although the host detested this mindless killing, the dignified seven-year-old vowed to serve as Culann’s hound until he found a suitable replacement. Thus the boy earned his adult name, for Cú indicates hound, and the hero became known as "the hound of Culann" from then on. The next time we hear of the young hero, he grew irate with his hurling companions, and killed them all with a strike to the head, becoming practically unrecognizable due to the ferocity of his rage. He marched back to Concobar’s fortress while still seething with anger, and when he fought, he went into what was known as the “warp-spasm,” with one eye sinking into his skull while the other bulged out, and blood and light rays emanating from his head. It required numerous huge containers of water to douse his fury. The time arrived for Cúchulainn to court a woman when he reached maturity, and he chose the lovely Emer, who possessed all the finest qualities of womanhood, just as he did of manhood. Emer’s father, Forgall Manach, did not consent to the match, and dispatched Cúchulainn on what he believed to be a senseless errand: to learn from the Warrior Woman Scáthach in Scotland. Cúchulainn persuaded the accomplished warrior to teach him her secrets, which are similar to the remarkable feats seen in martial-arts movies today. An outstanding technique that appears to be his own creation was the Salmon-leap, a type of playful pounce that rendered Cúchulainn practically invincible in combat. In spite of his pledge to stay true to Emer, his intended spouse, while in Scotland, Cúchulainn had a brief affair with the warrior Aífe, who bore him a son. When the boy had grown into a young man, Aífe bequeathed Cúchulainn’s ring to him and dispatched him to Ireland. The lad declined to reveal his identity to his father, and thus Cúchulainn unknowingly killed Connla. Despite tying the knot with Emer in the end, Cúchulainn had multiple infidelities, among them one with the fairy queen Fand, who lured him away from human existence. None of these dalliances, however, led to another child. Cúchulainn’s most celebrated exploit was his solitary defense of Concobar’s Ulster against the invasion initiated by queen Medb to steal the cattle. His primary weapon was his spear, Gáe Bulga. Being a non-Ulsterman, Cúchulainn did not experience the weakness caused by Macha's dying curse, wherein the men of Ulster would suffer pain similar to childbirth for four days and five nights every time their territory was attacked. While the Ulstermen were agonizing, Cúchulainn repelled one hero after another, slaying them all in individual combat, including his dear foster brother Ferdiad. (For a complete account of Cúchulainn’s exploits in that epic battle, examine Táin Bó Cuailnge.) He violated his Geis or sacred vow never to consume dog meat and died. Several tales related to his death exist in ancient texts, but one fact remains constant: he refused to meet his demise in any other way than standing. Chained to a pillar, Cúchulainn endured a barrage of javelins and other weapons even after his death, only being officially declared gone when the carrion Crows, servants of the goddess Badb, swooped down to peck at his eyes. Cúchulainn's legend has continued to inspire a wealth of literature since his heroic era. W.B. Yeats channeled the hero in several plays such as The Only Jealousy of Emer, depicting his affair with the fairy queen Fand, and On Baile’s Strand, delving into his accidental killing of his only son. Morgan Llywelyn's historical novel Red Branch offers further insight into the mythology of Cúchulainn.
