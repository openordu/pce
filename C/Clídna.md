Clídna, also recorded as Cleena, Clíodna, Cliodna, Clíona and Clidna Centfind, is an Irish heroine or goddess who is believed to be associated with the ninth wave during every sequence of nine waves. This largest wave is named Tonn Clíodhna after the goddess who was acknowledged to be the most beautiful woman in the world, namely Clídna of the Fair Hair. Within the southwestern province of Munster, Clídna is particularly linked to the area and is sometimes known as its Fairy Queen, even though this title is also attributed to Áine and Aeval. Initially connected with the fairy hill located in Cork named Carrig Cliodna and the adjacent offshore rocks called Carrigcleena, it is reasonable to assume that, much like other fairy queens, she could have initially come from the land as a goddess. Clídna is related to many romantic stories that have been recorded. One of them indicates that she was wooed by Ciabhán, the womanizing outcast of the heroic squad called the Fianna, who succeeded in winning her hand in marriage in her home country of Tír Tairngiri or the Land of Promise. In contrast to most human suitors of fairy women, Ciabhán was able to travel freely between this world and the Otherworld. When he went hunting on the mainland of Ireland, he brought Clídna with him to Glandore or the "Golden Harbour." As Clídna took a nap in their boat, her lover disembarked. However, a massive wave flipped over the boat, causing the beautiful Clídna to drown. Despite this account of her demise, Clídna went on to live and experience more romantic escapades. She fell in love with a man named John Fitzjames, who was already involved with a human lover named Caitileen Óg. Caitileen Óg followed Clídna into the Otherworld and angrily demanded the return of her lover. The charm and wit of Caitileen Óg fell short in convincing Clídna from letting her lover go, despite coming close to succeeding. Clídna had romantic relationships with notable Irish families, such as Earl Gerald Fitzgerald of the Desmond Geraldines, who was the son of fairy queen Áine, and Caomh, who was an ancestor of the O’Keeffes. Banshee Cládna was also associated with the MacCarthys and shared with them the secret of the Blarney Stone, a belief that touching it with one's lips grants eloquence; a superstition upheld to these modern times. Clídna's affiliation with nobility hints that she could have been the goddess of the Sovereignty of sea-lapped Munster.
