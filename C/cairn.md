Mounds of rocks, known as cairns, can be found at significant locations throughout Celtic lands, including mountain tops. The Megalithic Civilization left these structures, and it is unknown whether their interior holds chambers. The Celts later used cairns for their own mythological purposes, resulting in numerous sites becoming legends and potentially being used for rituals as well (see Court Tombs).
