On a hill by the village of Cerne Abbas in Dorset, England lies the Cerne Abbas Giant, a British mythological site and figure of folklore. The massive man-shaped figure, over 200 feet tall, has had the verdant green turf removed from it down to the white chalky soil. Despite its notoriety, the Giant remains nameless, and its creator remains unknown. Speculation runs rife as to its origins; while similar turf-cut figures like the White Horse of Uffington have been dated to the Iron Age, no concrete evidence has placed the Cerne Abbas Giant within any given period. Many scholars postulate that the Giant had already been carved into the hillside long before the Durotriges, a Celtic tribe who lived in the area, arrived. However, others argue that the Giant's features link him to other Celtic mythologies. The celebrated feature of the figure is its immense erection, which is 30 feet long, leading many to assume a connection with fertility. The figure has been associated with helping women become pregnant, and thus, outdoor assignations near or on the figure were commonplace. The Giant also carries a giant club, held aloft to emphasize its phallic symbolism-attributing him to the Irish Dagda and the continental Celtic Succelus, who both carry a similar, mallet-ended weapon or club.
