A motif prevalent in Scottish and British folklore involves countless stones. A popular legend recounts the existence of Stone Circles constructed by the pre-Celtic populace of Britain. It is said that one can never accurately count the number of stones in the circle. Ill-fate is believed to befall anyone who ventures to count the stones, particularly those of Stonehenge and Stanton Drew. According to certain accounts, a baker resolves to break the curse by placing a loaf of bread on each stone, but the loaves vanish as he proceeds around the circle, leaving the stones uncounted.
