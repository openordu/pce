The ancient Provinces of Ireland were called Cóiced Mythic theme or “a fifth.” There were four geographical provinces named Leinster, Munster, Connacht, and Ulster. Mide, or Meath, was considered the fifth province, which was not only a geographical concept but a cosmological one. It symbolized the real center, which was believed to be the hill of Uisneach or more specifically, the rock known as the Stone Of Divisions on that hill. Even when the province of Meath was located at the heart of Ireland in historical times, the mystical implications of the island’s provincial divisions were never abandoned.
