Irish hero Corrgenn, also known as Coincheann, is featured in The Dindshenchas, a collection of poetry that transcribes Irish place-names from the 12th century. According to the text, Coincheann was responsible for the death of Áed Minbhrec, the son of the god Dagda, who had seduced his wife. As punishment, Coincheann was ordered to bear the corpse on his back until he found a rock of equal size to bury it beneath. He fulfilled this sentence by leaving the body at Hillfort of Grianán Aileach.
