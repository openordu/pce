In various regions of the continental Celtic world, models of what is believed to be a Goddess have been found being transported on a cart or wagon. These models date back to as early as the Celtic era, around 800 B.C.E. The Strettweg cart, made of bronze, depicts this female figure. Similarly, the Gundestrup Cauldron, which is believed to have Celtic or Celtic-inspired origins, features small men riding alongside a cart, on which a larger feminine figure is being carried. There is not much textual proof of a cart-related ceremony, aside from the account given by Tacitus, a Roman historian, of a Germanic rite in which a goddess was transported in a wagon, drawn by oxen, throughout the land in springtime. A similar rite was conducted in Celtic Gaul, where the goddess was known by the name Berecynthia, which is not otherwise familiar. In certain regions, the annual conveyance of the goddess through the greening spring continued even after Christianization. Early medieval records attest to the goddess traveling through the fields in her cart to safeguard the crops.
