An important Irish mythological site is Cruachan, also known as Crogan, Rathcrogan, Cruachain, Crúachu, Rathcruachain, or Bri Ele. It was situated in the eastern part of the western Province of Connacht, and its capital was Cruachan, where the great queen and goddess, Medb, held her seat. Much like Emain Macha in Ulster and Tara in Meath, Cruachan was one of Ireland's most significant ancient sites. Even today, one can still visit it, characterized by earthworks and antiquities, numbering 49. The area's land rises gradually, giving even small raths and other earthworks a broad view of the province and midlands. The central rath, after which the site is named, reaches a height of 4 meters and a diameter of 88 meters. Other earthworks in the region include Dáithi's Mound, which has a tall standing stone at its peak, avenues similar to those at Tara, and most importantly, the Cave of the Cats, Oweynagat. Medb was the figure most closely associated with Cruachan, where she was born to Crochan Crocderg, who named the entire area. Medb lived in Cruachan with her husband, Ailill. Although nothing is left of the supposed fort, there is an unexcavated steep-sided rath near the center of the archaeological site, surrounded by five concentric circles. The Rath of the Bulls, also present on the two-mile-square site, recalls the most significant story from Cruachan. It is the Táin Bó Cuailnge or Cattle Raid of Cooley, which embarked from Cruachan on Samhain, marking a critical expedition for the region. At Cruachan, another great epic called the Echtra Nerai or Adventures of Nera took place during Samhain. This story features one of Ailill's men who ventured into the Otherworld by way of Oweynagat. Nora Chadwick does not mention herself in her writing and does not introduce topics but instead dives right into the discussion of Samhain and the Echtra Nerai, a story set at Cruachan in which one of Ailill's men descends to the Otherworld through Oweynagat.
