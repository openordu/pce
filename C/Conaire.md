Conaire, also known as Conare, Conaire Mór, or Conaire Mess Buachalla, was an Irish hero. His mother, Mess Buachalla, had a child with the bird god Nemglan making Conaire the grandson of the fairy queen Étain. The importance of every sacred vow or Geis that was required of the ruler is emphasized in Conaire's story. Conaire became the king of Tara after a Divination (see Bull-Sleep) revealed that he was the rightful ruler. Once inaugurated, he was required to meet certain demands, one of which was to never stand between two competing vassals. Unfortunately, he disregarded this stipulation and got involved in a disagreement between his brothers. On his return to Tara, he broke other vows such as letting red riders pass him on his horse, riding with Tara on his right hand, and entering a hostel after nightfall. When he reached the hostel, a formidable Hag approached him and requested entry. But Conaire remembered the last of his geasa which stated that no woman should be alone with him at night in Da Derga’s hostel (see Da Derga). The Hag cursed him, and he was plagued with an unquenchable thirst while the hostel burst into flames. As a result of his inauguration, he became the lady of the land's Sovereignty's spouse, and the fierce hag that threatened him at his demise could have been her disguised in a vengeful form.
