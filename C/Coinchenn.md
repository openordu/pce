A fierce fighter from Irish mythology known as Coinchenn or Coinchend was cursed to die if her daughter Delbcháem ever got married. As a result, she would confront every suitor who came for Delbcháem and defeat them, displaying their heads on poles to create a gruesome fence. To protect her daughter, Coinchenn kept her hidden in a tall tower. The only man to defeat Coinchenn was Art Mac Cuinn, the king of Tara who received help from the Fairies. Ultimately, Art won Delbcháem's hand in marriage.
