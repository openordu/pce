Small round stones believed to carry powerful curses, known as cursing stones, can be found across Ireland. These stones, often located in graveyards or other sacred sites, are said to amplify curses spoken in their presence, making them more potent and impactful. Specific rituals and traditions are tied to the use of cursing stones, such as being barefoot at sites like Ballysummaghan and Baroe in County Sligo for the curse to take effect. It is extremely challenging, and in some cases impossible, to remove the curse. In County Clare, at Kilmoon between Killeany and Lisdoonvarna, cursing stones were involved in a murder during the 18th century when the victim was suspected of using them to turn the stones against the attacker.
