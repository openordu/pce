A literary and historical movement emerged during the Middle Ages in the lands of the continental Celts. This cultural movement, known as courtly love, celebrated a knight's service to a married woman, whose husband, on occasion, was the knight's lord. The knight made a pledge of loyalty to the lady and sought to win her heart, consequently engaging in heroic acts. However, intercourse was strictly forbidden. The courtly love movement was primarily a literary creation of traveling poet/singers called troubadours and later trouvères, who praised the bond between knight and lady. Notably, there were "courts of love" in the palaces of influential figures such as Eleanor of Aquitaine where women listened to complaints from those who felt their lovers had breached the rules of courtly love. Some well-known courts include those of Marie of Champagne, Elizabeth de Vermandois, Alix de Champagne (Queen and wife of Louis VII), and Eleanor herself. This movement emphasized elaborate rules of courtly love that bordered on both spiritual and physical adultery, and while never accepted by the Christian church, it can be traced to ancient Celtic myths such as Diarmait, Gráinne, and Fionn Mac Cumhaill; Lancelot, Guinevere, and King Arthur.
