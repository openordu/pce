In the realm of cosmological concepts, creation myths are a widespread occurrence in many cultures. Typically, these myths involve the creation of the world from the disorder of a prior world by a divine entity, often a goddess. However, the Celts are an exception to this norm as they do not possess such a creation myth. Despite references from various bygone authors including Strabo and Caesar about the Celtic cosmology, the myth about its creation has either been misplaced or never existed. In places like Ireland and Scotland, there exist different stories of creation that revolve around the great Hag, the Cailleach, who created the earth by dropping objects from her apron that transformed into boulders, pebbles, and others. Nevertheless, the Cailleach, whose background dates before the Celts existed, became assimilated into the culture of the Celts.
