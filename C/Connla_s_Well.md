Located somewhere in Tipperary is Connla's Well, also known as Cóelrind's well, named after an unknown Fairy or mortal. Its whereabouts are unclear, whether in the Otherworld or under the sea. Nine Hazel trees, hanging over the well, drop nuts into the water, with a plump salmon (or trout) feasting off them, each nut leaving mottled spots on the fish's skin. If one was to successfully locate the well, there are three options to consider: eating the nuts, drinking the water, or catching the salmon to consume. Any of these actions would lead to the attainment of wisdom and inspiration. Sínann, the river goddess, was one of the well's discoverers, but her success came at the cost of her own life.
