A Welsh hero known as Caswallawn, also referred to as Casswallon, Caswallan and Caswallan fab Beli Mawr, features in the Welsh stories compiled as the Mabinogion. He was a warrior who possessed a cloak of invisibility, granting him a significant advantage in battle. Utilizing his cloak, he attacked his own relatives and seized the throne of Brân The Blessed from his son Caradawg, while Brân was away in Ireland fighting for the liberation of his sister, Branwen. Caswallawn vied with the Roman emperor Julius Caesar for the affections of the beautiful Fflur, who may have been a form of the goddess of Sovereignty, and her favor would have sanctioned a man to rule.
