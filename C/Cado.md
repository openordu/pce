Mythological figure Cado, known as a sea god or sea monster from Brittany, forced the lovely pagan princess Dahut to dwell under the ocean waves with him, resulting in the destruction of Dahut's magnificent city of Ys. Some versions of the tale refer to Dahut's consort as the Devil. Additionally, in the story of princess Blondine, Cado appears as an unfaithful suitor who betrays his betrothed after delivering her from the imprisonment of her magician father.
