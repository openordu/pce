The Celts considered birds to be symbolic animals as they believed that like trees, birds also existed in two worlds - the Otherworld and this one. Magical birds, such as the crane, which could belong to air, land, and water, were deemed especially potent. Cranes were usually representative of the feminine force, especially when they appeared in numbers of three. Since they stood upright, they were believed to have originally been human. Folklore regards cranes as representatives of bad will and miserliness. In one of the most famous Irish myths about cranes, the Children Of Lir, Flonnuala and her brothers were transformed into swans by their evil sorceress stepmother, Aífe, who was herself cursed to be a crane. The curse of a strange stance resembling that of a crane, where a person would stand on one leg while extending one arm, was employed as a curse in olden times. When King Conaire broke his sacred vows, the goddess Badb assumed this position at Da Derga’s hostel and cursed him. Since an ancient Irish taboo prohibited eating crane’s meat, some have deduced that the bird previously had a totemic function as an ancestral divinity or symbol.
