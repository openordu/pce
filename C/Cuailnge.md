Cooley, the lush peninsula on the east coast of Ireland, sits just below Carlingford Lough, a narrow bay named after the Viking Carling who raided the area in historic times. The vibrant region juts out into the Irish Sea and is typically anglicized as Cooley. On the north side of the bay, the Mountains of Mourne, with their blue-gray shades, rise. On the south, the low forested Cooley Mountains run along the spine of the peninsula. Cooley is famous in Irish myth for being home to the magical bull Donn Cuailnge and the site from which queen Medb launched the Táin or Cattle raid from her stronghold in Cruachan. Further information on the Táin Bó Cuailnge can be found.
