Conán is a name common in Irish mythology, borne by many minor figures in the heroic cycles. It means "wolf" and is associated with the heroic figure Conán mac Morna (Conan Maeol), a comic blusterer also known as "Conán of the Bitter Tongue," who has been compared to the Scandinavian trickster Loki. Despite being bald and wearing a black fleece wig, he was a tubby buffoon who was close friends with the heroic Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Another hero named Conan was Fionn's son, known as Conan Muil or Conan the Bald, who lost his scalp after being swallowed by the great monster Caoranach.
