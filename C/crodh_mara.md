Scottish folklore describes a creature known as crodh mara. As legend has it, the Fairies possessed hornless, mystical cattle that dwelt in the depths of the ocean. These creatures would occasionally venture onto land to mate with mortal cows, resulting in improved herds. Most accounts depict them as red, which is a common color among fairy beings, while others claim they appeared gray or dun-colored.
