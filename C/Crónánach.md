An Irish hero known as Crónánach is described as having an unattractive appearance, but in spite of it, he played the pipes perfectly. Crónánach belonged to the Otherworld and was a part of the Fenian Cycle. As soon as the first light of day appeared, he would change his guise and become a stunning man who could be taken for a king.
