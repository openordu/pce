A female figure known as Caolainn is associated with a healing well in Co. Roscommon. As the legend goes, she had healed herself of a self-inflicted wound by gouging out her own eyes when a man spoke admiringly of them. She then threw her eyes at him and groped her way to the well, where she tore rushes from the perimeter and wiped her bloody sockets, only to find that her eyes had grown back. A similar tale is attributed to Brigit, the Christian saint, who was also linked to wells that supposedly offered treatment for eye complaints. Caoranach, an Irish mythological being, was a monstrous serpent who lived in the waters of Lough Derg in Donegal, located in Ulster. At the Christian pilgrimage site of Station Island, a stone is pointed out as the skeleton of this creature, now known as the Altar of Confession. Resembling a Bullaun, an ancient pitted stone whose purpose remains unclear, the indented stone is associated with the serpent, who, like Corra (the Devil's Mother), a sky demon that may have been the same mythical creature, was killed by St. Patrick. Immersed in the waters of the lake, the battle between St. Patrick and Caoranach lasted two nights and two days. Caoranach was a notorious creature that could pull men and cattle into her voracious mouth, and was equally considered a harbinger of doom. The inner light of her lair was regarded as a portent of death, as those who saw it were said to die within a year. According to numerous legends, St. Patrick was unable to kill Caoranach, who has supposedly remained alive in the lake and reappears during stormy weather. Like a Water Horse, she was capable of consuming prey and brought about misfortune. Caoranach is connected to mythological heroes like Fionn Mac Cumhaill and his son, Conan, as earlier legends suggest. According to a popular tale, when the shinbones of Fionn's mother were thrown into Lough Derg, Caoranach promptly emerged from them. Conan was swallowed by the serpent as soon as she reached the shore, but he emerged by fighting his way out of her belly and killing her. As a consequence, Conan retained the name "Conan Muil," meaning "bald Conan," because he was both hairless and skinless after his emergence. The lake turned red when the serpent died, provoking the name "Dark Lake." In contrast, a Christian version of the story implies that Caoranach swallowed Patrick himself, but he managed to cut his way out with his crosier.
