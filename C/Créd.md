Two mountains, referred to as the Paps of Danu, are affiliated with Créd, an Irish heroine and Fairy Queen. To become Créd's lover, a man had to compose a laudatory poem describing the palace where she resided, which was heavily guarded and unseen. Cáel, a poet and seer, created a beautiful poem using his inner sight to penetrate Créd's defenses, and his words earned her affection. The poem that won Créd's heart spoke of how wounded men, bleeding heavily, would sleep to the melody of fairy birds singing in her palace's bright foliage. Créd awarded Cáel a magical battle-dress to protect him; however, he was killed while serving his king. Créd, heartbroken over the death of her lover, threw herself into the grave with him and perished too. She was a poet herself, and one of her songs is in the Colloquy of the Elders. A heroine with the same name may have been the daughter of the legendary king Guaire and the ancestral mother of the O'Connors. She similarly died tragically when she fell in love with the warrior poet, Cano Mac Gartnáin, despite being married to another king. Cano, once a resident of Scotland, was visiting her husband's home where he was smitten with Créd. Similarly, Créd was taken with Cano and gave everyone but him a sleeping draught as she disclosed her desire to him. Cano's pride prevented him from consummating his love with Créd until he had regained his patrimony. As a symbol of his love, he gave her his External Soul, which contained his essence. Créd's stepson intervened, causing so much suffering that Créd took her own life, crushing the stone that held Cano's soul in the process. Several days passed before Cano died.
