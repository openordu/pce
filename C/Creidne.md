Creidne, an Irish deity, was a skilled artisan, belonging to the magical group known as the Tuatha Dé Danann. Being one of the three craft gods, na trí dée Dána alongside Goibniu and Luchtar, he specialized in crafting precious metals like bronze and gold. In the battle against their formidable foes, the Fomorians, Creidne played a vital role, creating weapons for his people. There are conflicting tales about whether he crafted a silver hand for King Nuada or if it was Dian Cécht who performed that feat. Despite his exceptional abilities, Creidne met an untimely demise while attempting to import gold from Spain. Additionally, there was another individual named Creidne who fought alongside the legendary Fianna as one of the Warrior Women.
