A certain heroine or goddess named Corra appears in Irish mythology. The narrative tells how she was defeated by St. Patrick, who hurled his silver bell at her and caused her to fall from the sky on top of the mountain now known as Croagh Patrick. Corra subsequently drowned in Lough Corra, located at the foot of the mountain. Other versions of the legend suggest that Patrick pursued her across the land, leading to her demise in Lough Derg where the serpent monster Caoranach also resided. Some have speculated that this is how the folklore began that Patrick had driven the snakes from the isle, when in reality they never existed there (see Serpent). Corra is sometimes viewed as a Mother Goddess whose influence was suppressed by the emergence of patriarchal Christianity.
