Folkloric motif pertaining to crossing water is found in some Celtic regions such as the Isle of Man. According to the belief, Fairies were unable to cross running water. So, if one was being chased by the Wild Hunt, running across a stream would provide shelter. However, standing water was not considered an alternative since fairies resided in or beneath waves of lakes, particularly in Ireland.
