Conn of the Hundred Battles, known in Irish as Con Cétchathach, was revered as one of the greatest legendary kings of Ireland. He was deemed the true king when he approached the magical stone Lia Fáil which screamed and designated him as such. To ensure that he was not taken by surprise by his people's monstrous enemies, the Fomorians, Conn walked the ramparts of Tara daily. Before ruling as king at Tara, he governed the north of Ireland, while his adversary Eógan Mór controlled the south. The Eiscir Riada, a range of glacial hills separated them. Conn did not wish to remain solely in his sector, invading and defeating Eógan in his domain. Eógan sought assistance and returned to battle, but was defeated again by Conn at Mag Léna where he met his end. Conn earned the title "of the hundred battles" or "fighter of hundreds" from these and other conquests. Stories about Conn place emphasis on the importance of a monarch's relationship with the land to ensure its fruitfulness. After being offered the cup of Sovereignty by an unknown beautiful woman, he selected the virtuous Eithne Táebfhorta as his queen. His benevolent reign rendered the land more fertile, resulting in three harvests each year. However, when he married Bé Chuma, who had been banished from the Otherworld for her immoral behavior, the land suffered, and no cows yielded milk until Conn banished the Fairy woman. A significant character in tales from the Fenian Cycle is Conn. It was during his rule that the renowned hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill came to be. Various accounts narrate the incident of Conn executing Cumhall, Fionn's father, for abducting and assaulting his mother, Murna. Nevertheless, Fionn remained friendly towards Conn. Art Mac Cuinn and Connla are among Conn's offspring.
