Arthurian hero Colgrevance, known for his minor role in the Owein and the Lady Of The Fountain story, was the first knight to face the guardian of the fountain - a mysterious Black Knight who also happened to be the lady's husband. His defeat at the hands of the Black Knight prompted Colgrevance to return to Camelot and share the tale, which eventually inspired the protagonist Owein to win over the guardian.
