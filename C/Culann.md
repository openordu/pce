A significant Irish hero was Culann, a smith who created weapons for Concobar Mac Nessa, the foster father of Cúchulainn. Once, when Culann was hosting the Ulster men, a boy named Sétanta arrived late and carelessly murdered his beloved dog. Culann was furious, but Sétanta proposed to take the dog's place until they could find a new one, earning himself the new name of "hound of Culann." Some sources combine Culann with Cuilenn, who might be the same or based on the same person.
