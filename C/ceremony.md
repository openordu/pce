Celtic religion had a decentralized structure, resulting in no apparent rituals practiced by all Celts. Even crucial events connected with the Celtic calendar, such as Beltane fires and plaited rush crosses during Imbolc, are typically ascribed only to the Irish. Therefore, these are not universal practices throughout Celtic territories. Rites of passage, including those surrounding marriage or initiation, were also varied among Celtic Europeans. Meanwhile, customs related to death were flexible and may even include cremation or exhumation rituals. The only ritual featuring evidence of widespread practice was the kingly Inauguration ceremony. This ritual included a woman, symbolizing the earth goddess, providing a drink or possibly refreshments to the newly crowned king. However, this specific ritual was not found in different Celtic lands across Europe. Some experts believe it originated among non-Celtic people, while others suggest that it resembles similar rituals in India of Indo-European origin. What characterizes Celtic religion is the worldview or shared cosmology, not shared ceremonies or rituals. Outdoor festivals are preferred over building shrines or temples to honor nature because the Celts view nature as sacred. They do not hold a dualistic worldview, meaning divinities come in pairs that complement each other rather than oppose each other. Celtic society also features a threefold division of society, referred to as the king, nobles, and commoners, as reflected in certain aspects of their religion. While there is no indication of any panCeltic ritual or ceremony, Celtic religion is distinct because of these shared values and perspectives.
