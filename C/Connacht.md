A site of Irish mythology is Connacht (also spelled Connaught or Connachta). In ancient Ireland, the land was split into four or five provinces known as CÃ³iced in Irish. The westernmost province was Connacht, which was named after King Conn of the Hundred Battles in some legends. The other provinces were Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and occasionally Mide. The province of Connacht is correlated with "wisdom" due to the first syllable of its name, and this location is traditionally associated with the Fairy Folk who were believed to favor the west. In ancient times, Connacht was associated with education, histories and stories, science, eloquence, and various types of learning. The capital of ancient Connacht was Cruachan. The current province of Connacht is made up of Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, and Roscommon, and is today one of Ireland's smallest and poorest provinces. It has long been viewed as a stronghold of traditional culture, for conquerors often forced the Irish "to hell or Connacht," as Oliver Cromwell famously put it. Many Americans trace their ancestry to this region due to the massive emigration during the 19th-century famine years caused by poverty.
