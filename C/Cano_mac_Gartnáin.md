A remarkable figure in Irish mythology is Cano mac Gartnáin, who is often compared to Cáel because both were warrior poets adored by Créd, the princess of Connacht and daughter of the renowned king Guaire. Cano found refuge in Ireland after his father was killed, and although Créd was already married to a king, they immediately and desperately fell in love. Cano, who refused to consummate their relationship until he regained his own kingdom, entrusted his External Soul in the form of a stone to Créd. However, their plans to rendezvous were disrupted by Créd’s stepson, who was also the child of her former husband. As a result, the queen despondently killed herself, crushing Cano’s soul-stone and putting an end to his life.
