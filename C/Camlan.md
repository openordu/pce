Welsh mythology features Camlan (also written as Camlaun or Camlann), a site whose location remains unknown. According to early writers, this place was the site of the last battle fought by King Arthur before he was defeated by his son/nephew Mordred. From there, the legendary Lady of The Lake took him to the Otherworld.
