Mythic story sequence, the Cycle of the Kings (Historical Cycle), is one of the several significant sequences in Irish mythology. These cycles revolve around different figures, geographic areas, and eras. The Ulster Cycle focuses on the heroes of that province, such as Cúchulainn, Concobar Mac Nessa, and Fergus mac Roich, who stands with their great rival Medb. The Fenian Cycle centers on Fionn Mac Cumhaill and his warriors' group, the Fianna, comprising of Oisín and Diarmait. The Mythological Cycle includes narratives of the gods themselves, including the Tuatha Dé Danann great divinities. The Historical Cycle, otherwise known as the Cycle of the Kings, involves stories of the kings of Tara, like Conn of the Hundred Battles and Niall of the Nine Hostages, alongside Art Mac Cuinn and the mad king Suibhne. Numerous myths incorporated into this cycle focuses on the king's righteousness or lack thereof and its outcomes. Though some of the kings have historical records, the tales related to them are hyperbolized and fantastical. Like other Irish mythological texts, these tales disclose some aspects of the past, but their accuracy is subject to debate.
