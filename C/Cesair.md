An Irish goddess or heroine known as Cesair (also spelled Cessair, Cesara, Kesair, Heriu, Berba) is believed to be the first settler of Ireland, according to the Book of Invasions. The book was written after Ireland had already become a Christian land and was created by monks who aimed to portray the country as a sacred place. As a result, they intertwined the mythological history of Ireland with biblical tales. In this context, Cesair was identified as the granddaughter of Noah, who survived the great Flood by sailing away from the Holy Land. However, while Noah's vessel was filled with animals, Cesair's held people only, consisting of 50 women and three men. Four days prior to the start of the flood, Cesair and her followers found refuge in Ireland, a place that remained unaffected by the catastrophic deluge. Her journey was long and indirect, as she left from Meroe to sail down the Nile and then through the Caspian and Cimmerian seas. She then traversed over the inundated Alps, a journey that took nine days before finally reaching Spain, where she sailed for another nine days to finally arrive in Ireland. Cesair and her crew landed at Bantry Bay in County Cork's southwest, where they divided the land. Given that only three men were present, Cesair formed three groups, each with at least a dozen women and one man. The women's insatiable demands were too much to handle, leading to the death of Cesair's father, Bith, and brother, Ladra, from sexual exertion. The last man, Fintan mac Bóchra, fled from the vigilant women. Accompanying Cesair were women who, by their names, symbolized the ancestral mothers of the world. These women included Germans (German), Spanish (Espa), British (Alba), Thracians (Traige), and Goths (Gothiam), forming a microcosm of the global populace arriving in Ireland. Several other companions bore names resembling those of ancient Irish goddesses, such as Banba and Búanann. Some suggest that Cesair was a land goddess, possibly the daughter of the earth goddess Banba, while others believe that she was Berba (the goddess of the River Barrow) or Heriu, a name similar to that of the primary land goddess, Ériu. Therefore, Cesair may have been a form of, or integrated with, these influential divinities. Cesair and her companions made up a parallel group to the better-known group of Banba, Fódla, and Ériu, as demonstrated by the fact that three men split up the women, with each taking a primary bride (Fintan with Cesair, Bith with Bairrind, and Ladra with Banba).
