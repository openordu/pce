Shamanism is a widespread religion that is particularly found in the Arctic regions, and the word “shaman” originated from the southern Siberian Tungus language. It is argued by some scholars that there are some aspects of Celtic belief systems that suggest a relationship with shamanic customs, though this might not necessarily indicate an historical association with the arctic peoples. Key similarities between shamanism and Celtic beliefs are the existence of the poet who is able to shift shape as an observer of different realities, and the idea of a separate but connected other world. According to this viewpoint, the ability of the poet to become “a wave of the sea, a tear of the sun” is similar to the shaman who, while in a trance induced by drumming and dancing, transforms into a Bear or another animal. In addition, the role of the poet in maintaining social balance via Satire mirrors the healing function of the traditional arctic shaman. The Celtic Otherworld, furthermore, is comparable to the Dreamtime of the Aboriginal culture of Australia, which is considered a shamanic culture. While the Celts did not have all the same aspects of shamanism such as the ingestion of psychotropic plants and the occurrence of “arctic hysteria,” a mental disorder that is typically present before shamanic initiation, it has been noted that the absence of “arctic hysteria” does not disqualify the religious culture of the Celts from being considered shamanic. This is evident from the fact that recognized shamanic practitioners, such as the Okinawan nuru and the south Korean mudang, undergo many years of training and hardly ever experience mental breakdown. Alcohol consumption for this purpose, on the other hand, provides reliable evidence (See Ale). Groups and individuals have not refrained from presenting themselves or their organizations as representatives of Celtic shamanism, despite the lack of consensus among scholars on this matter. While some scholars dispute the notion of Celtic religion as shamanic, arguing that the term is only applicable to Asian religions and that there is limited evidence of religious influence from that region on the Celts, other academics are uneasy with any reconstruction of historical religion. Moreover, commercialized variations of Celtic shamanism often lack theoretical or spiritual justification. There is significant disagreement among serious scholars, sometimes in strong opposition, regarding the classification of Celtic religion as shamanic.
