A hero of the Fianna in Ireland was Cáel (or Caol), who became known for his legendary romance with Créd. Cáel, a slender hero, was able to capture the heart of Créd by reciting praise-poetry to her. Créd had challenged the Bards of Ireland to create a poem about her palace. No man had ever entered into it, and the prize at stake was her own hand. Cáel utilized the telepathic abilities taught in his poetry training to craft the winning verse. However, Cáel was tragically killed in battle, leaving Créd to face overwhelming sorrow. Overcome with grief, Créd climbed into Cáel's burial mound, lying beside him one last time before passing away as well, consumed by sorrow.
