Cet, also known as Cet mac Mágach, was an Irish hero who was known for his bravery and eloquence. He was particularly skilled at boasting about his abilities in battle. In some legends, Cet was responsible for naming Cúchulainn, who would later become the greatest warrior of his people. Another prominent figure in Irish mythology is Cethern mac Fintain, who served as the tutor to the great hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Fionn gained all of the world's wisdom by eating part of a salmon named Fintan. Since Cethern's name connects him to Fintan, his inclusion in the tales may serve to strengthen the connection between Fionn and Fintan.
