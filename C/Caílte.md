An Irish hero named Caílte, also known as Cailte or Caoilte, was a member of the Fianna and Fionn Mac Cumhaill's nephew. He worked as a hunter for the beautiful Gráinne and was known for his extraordinary talents. Caílte was a poet who entertained the group by reciting verses and singing songs after supper. He was also famous for his athletic ability and incredible speed. The text shares some of Caílte's remarkable feats such as herding rabbits by running around them, picking up a handful of sand from every beach in Ireland every morning, and running the entire length and breadth of Ireland in a single day. One story shared that he challenged the Hag goddess Cailleach to a race at Cruachan and decapitated her as he won, while another tale tells of him racing with a young and beautiful woman. Caílte was unable to outrun change, and in the Colloquy Of The Elders, he argued against St. Patrick's preaching of Christianity, which eventually won against the pagan values that Caílte defended.
