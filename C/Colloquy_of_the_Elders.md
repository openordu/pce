Irish mythological text, the Colloquy of the Elders (also known as the Colloquy of the Sages or Ancients, Acallam na Senórach, Agallamh na Seanórach) is an important narrative source for numerous legends of the Fianna. The text was composed in the 12th century, most likely by Christian monks. It recounts the story of two Fianna members, Oisín and Caílte, who, after an extended stay in Fairyland, met with St. Patrick and engaged in a discussion with him about religion and values. Together with the Christian monk, they journeyed, highlighting holy sites and sharing stories related to them (refer to Dindshenchas). Although the text was written during Christian times, it satirizes Patrick while showing reverence to the two elderly survivors of pagan Ireland.
