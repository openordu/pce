Cáer Ibormeith, an Irish deity or heroine, appears in a poignant Irish love story as the object of affection of Aonghus Óg, the sweet god of poetry. Aonghus grew so lovesick for a woman he had repeatedly dreamed of that he set out on a quest to search for her in the world. Eventually, he found Cáer, swimming as a swan covered in 130 golden chains on the Lake of Dragon's Mouths. Upon seeing her, Aonghus himself turned into a swan, and the two of them flew away singing a melody so enchanting that those who heard it fell sound asleep for 3 days and 3 nights. This tale forms the basis for one of W. B. Yeats's most well-known poems, "The Song of Wandering Aengus."
