Crom Cruach, also known as Crom Crúaich, Cenn Cruaich, or Cromm Cruaich, was an Irish god who was regarded as the chief god in ancient Irish culture, although there are no known stories about his actions. Ancient sources record that he was worshiped in the form of stone idols, and that first-born children were sacrificed in his name. King Tigernmas is rumoured to have carried out this bloody practice every Samhain - sacrificing children by smashing their heads against the grotesque idol that may have been represented by the Killycluggan Stone, now on display in the National Museum of Ireland. Stone images like the Killycluggan Stone were said to have been destroyed by St. Patrick, who aimed to purify the land of pagan influences by following in the footsteps of such continental exemplars of piety as St. Martin of Tours. St. Patrick is purported to have demolished hundreds of Celtic and Roman statues. Although many standing stones, stone circles, and other images of the divine survived uninjured. Crom Cruach is sometimes linked to the Dagda, who was a “good god” that provided his children with abundance. Some scholars have claimed that Crom-eocha was a name of the Dagda. The Dindshenchas, which is ancient Irish place-poetry, describes Crom Cruach as a war-inciting idol that required first-born children’s blood to be poured upon it. The cruel deity promised to provide milk and corn for the remaining people as long as one-third of all children were sacrificed to him. The place where Crom Cruach's gold idol stood, surrounded by twelve imposing stone figures, was referred to as Mag Slecht, which is believed to be located in northeast Co. I will follow the writing style of Nora Chadwick, who abstains from bringing up personal references and topic introductions.
