This piece is about the name Conall which, meaning "wolf," is associated with a number of heroes. In Irish mythology, we have Conall, son of Eochaid, whose sons were turned into Badgers by the goddess Grian after attacking her fort on Knockgraney. In response, he fought Grian but neither emerged victorious until Grian sprinkled him with fairy dust which resulted in his unfortunate demise. Conall Cernach, "victorious Conall," is another great hero in the Ulster Cycle. He is son to the queen Findchóem and the poet Amairgin, and he is also the foster brother of Cúchulainn. Several texts feature this hero, and his marvelous deeds including swallowing a boar whole and killing many opponents in brutal fashion. Conall was the sole warrior to survive when his king, Conaire, was killed in the holocaust at the hostel of Da Derga. Lastly, Conall Gulban was the founder of the ancient kingdom of Tír Chonaill in Co. Donegal. He was the son of Niall of the Nine Hostages. His name was corrupted into Bulben, and he is associated with a state of mountainous terrain in Co. Sligo called BenBulben. Many stories surround him, with his chief legend involving his death while trying to rescue the fair Eithne from a kidnapping giant. In fact, he is second only to Fionn Mac Cumhaill in popularity when it comes to heroic figures in folktales.
