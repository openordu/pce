Irish mythology is replete with the champion's portion theme. A customary Celtic practice, it involves awarding the most notable warrior at a feast the curad-mír, or the most preferred part of the meat, usually the thigh. If two or more warriors laid claim to the prize, they hastily engaged in combat, which could lead to deadly outcomes. This convention has been documented since the first century B.C.E. Its existence provided Briccriu, with his sharp tongue, an opening to spark trouble by pitting several champions against each other.
