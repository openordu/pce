In Irish lore, there exist Clan Morna heroes who are the loyalists or the community that supports the renowned fighter named Goll Mac Morna. Their rivals are the Clan Baíscne, who fought alongside the hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Many battles ensued before the opposing clans put their differences aside and united to become the Fianna.
