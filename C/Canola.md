An Irish heroine named Canola is credited with inventing The Harp, which is now one of Ireland's most recognizable symbols. Canola had an argument with her lover and walked off into the night, eventually ending up at the seashore. There, she heard beautiful music and fell asleep under the stars. When she woke up, she realized the music had come from sinews still attached to the rib-bones of a whale, which the wind was playing like an instrument. This discovery inspired her to create the first harp.
