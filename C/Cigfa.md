Welsh heroine or goddess, Cigfa (Kigva), was married to Pryderi, who was Rhiannon's son and Pwyll's consort. In the third branch of the Welsh Mabinogion, Cigfa's husband became trapped along with his mother in a Fairy Mound by magical means. After this, Cigfa remained faithful to Rhiannon’s second husband, Manawydan. She broke the enchantment on their spouses by living chastely with him until he discovered a solution.
