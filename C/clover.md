Symbolic in nature, clovers hold magical significance. Four-leafed clovers in particular were believed to possess luck because they had the power to break the Glamour that Fairies used to mask the reality of their surroundings. By holding up this special clover, a person could witness things as they truly were; a Cave where previously one saw a cottage or a toothless old man where a handsome one had stood seconds before. Some speculate that Fairy Ointment featured oil extracted from four-leafed clovers as its main ingredient.
