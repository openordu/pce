An Arthurian site known as Celidon (Cellydon) is comparable to the legendary forest of Brocéliande in Brittany. The dense woods of Celidon are featured in several legends but their precise location remains a mystery. King Arthur's knights emerged victorious after engaging in a crucial battle that occurred at Celidon. During his period of madness, Merlin meandered through the same woods.
