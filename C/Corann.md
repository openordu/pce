Obscure as she may be, Corann is a name that resonates in the wooded area of Co. Sligo in the northwest of Ireland. She is either a heroine or goddess who mourned the loss of some of her beloved hunting dogs that were hunted down by a wild boar. With due respect, she opted to bury them and raise a ceremonial mound as a tribute to honor their memory.
