Mythological creatures called c’wn annwn (also known as cwn annwfn) were believed to exist in Welsh mythology. Similar to other Fairy beings, these hounds of the Otherworld had a red coat with white ears, though they were also able to mimic the appearance of regular beagles. However, their behavior was far from typical, as they would roam around the world and howl in a frightening manner. It was commonly believed that their presence signaled an impending death. For more information on similar legends, see Black Dog and Gabriel Hounds.
