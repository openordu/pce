Daughter of Tara's king Cathaír Mór, Cochrann was an Irish heroine who bore romantic hero Diarmait Ua Duibne and also his nemesis. Her infidelity with a shepherd who wielded magical powers resulted in her lover killing their newborn son. Yet, the child was revived by the shepherd's Hazel wand to emerge as the wild boar Donn Ua Duibne. Unhappy about his half-brother's resurrection and transformation, the boar aspired to avenge his sorry fate by taking on Diarmait.
