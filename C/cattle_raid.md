The stealing of cattle from neighboring kingdoms was an ongoing and dangerous sport for young men in ancient Ireland. Such men gained acclaim and power through their prowess in these cattle raids. Cattle represented wealth and power, which may have added a ritual aspect to the raids. These raids were part of Irish mythological stories, and appeared in numerous myths. The most famous of these myths involved Connacht’s queen Medb, who led an epic raid against the Province of Ulster. Medb's goal was to steal a great Bull who could match her husband’s legendary white bull, Finnbennach. This story is told in the epic Táin Bó Cuailnge. Another well-known cattle raid involved Fráech, the husband of Medb’s daughter Finnabair.
