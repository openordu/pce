The Corn Dolly, also known as the Corn Maiden, is a Scottish and Irish folkloric symbol that takes the shape of a human figure made from straw during harvest season. It is typically constructed from the final sheaf harvested during this time, and while its origin remains uncertain, it is believed to have mythic or ritual significance. The Corn Dolly is associated with two figures, the Cailleach or Hag and Brigit or the Bride, both of whom have unclear origins, with the latter potentially being a manifestation of the former. The doll is usually stored in a home or barn from autumn to spring, when it is used in various ceremonies related to new life and sowing.
