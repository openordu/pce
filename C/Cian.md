Cian, also known as Kian or Cian mac Cainte, was an Irish hero involved in a curious tale. The tale tells of how Balor, king of the Fomorians, learnt that he was going to be killed by his grandson. Believing he could avoid this fate, he confined his only daughter, Eithne, in a high tower, thinking she would never meet a man and thus never give birth to a child who could kill him. Balor's own desires ended up dooming him, as he took a liking to a magically abundant cow called the Glas Ghaibhleann, which was in the care of a man named Cian. Some versions say that Cian was the cow's owner, while others say he was just the cowherd, with the Smith as the true owner. Balor sailed over from his outpost on Tory Island, off Ireland's northwest coast, and stole the cow, taking it back to his distant home. Not wanting to lose such a precious animal, Cian embarked on a secret mission across the waters, where he found something even more valuable, the fair Eithne. With assistance from a Druid woman named Biróg, he dressed as a woman and entered the tower where he lured Eithne. She bore him three sons, but her father drowned two; the only one who survived was the hero Lugh. In versions of the story, Cian is named Kian or MacInelly; some legends indicate that he even impregnated Eithne's 12 other handmaids, all of whom gave birth to seals. Some tales portray Cian as a son of Dian Cécht, the physician god, which would make him one of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the people who worshiped the goddess Danu. Three brothers, the Sons Of Tuireann, murdered him due to the animosity between Cian and their father. He was attempting to dodge an encounter with the armed warriors, but to his disgrace, he was ambushed while he had Shape-Shifted into a Pig, simulating a search for acorns on the ground. He was unsuccessful in deceiving the brothers, who turned themselves into Dogs to hunt down Cian, and he was only allowed to shift back into human form just before his death. According to legend, the massive earthwork known as the Black Pig's Dyke is either his petrified remains or was built by Cian while he was in the form of a pig.
