A legendary character from Welsh mythology is Cath Paluc, also known as "Paluc's Cat." This creature, appearing in the form of a feline, was said to have consumed 180 men during each meal. Scholars have suggested that the existence of similar figures in Celtic lore might imply the existence of an ancient Cat cult, and Cath Paluc might be a remnant.
