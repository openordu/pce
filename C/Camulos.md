Camulos, a British deity, has scarce artifacts to decipher the extent of his divinity, although his name was integrated into the essential township of Camulodunum, meaning “fort of Camulos,” currently referred to as Colchester. The Roman conquerors linked Camulos to their god of war, Mars. Researchers have proposed that he could coincide with the Irish patriarch Cumhall, who fathered the hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill.
