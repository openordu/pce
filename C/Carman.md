Carman is a striking character of Irish mythology who was considered an Irish goddess or heroine. According to the legend, she governed Ireland in the earliest days and was a powerful sorceress who caused a lot of destruction. Carman had three sons who were equally troublesome: Dub (darkness), Dothur (wickedness), and Dian (violence), and their destructive efforts gravely affected Ireland's crops until the Tuatha Dé Danann, the people of the goddess Danu, gathered enough magic to banish Carman's sons from the land. This left Carman as the most significant hurdle. Initially, the Tuatha Dé sent a Bard and later a satirist to thwart her destructive energy, but both failed. Finally, Bé Chuille, a formidable sorceress, managed to cast a powerful spell that was sufficient enough to undo Carman's destructive energy. Upon learning that her sons had been slain, Carman died of grief. Despite the hostility between the Tuatha Dé and Carman, an impressive festival called the Óenach Carman was created in her honor. The location of the festival varied between the Curragh in Co. Kildare and the plains of the River Barrow in the same county, indicating that Carman was a powerful figure that needed to be appeased. Accompanied by similar festivals dedicated to goddesses Tailtiu and Tlachtga, it can be inferred that these female deities were traditionally linked to the harvest season.
