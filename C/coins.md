Symbolic objects, coins had been nonexistent among the Celts until the Romans arrived. The method for exchanging goods is not entirely understood but is thought to have been based on bartering. The introduction of metal coins was a revolutionary breakthrough, obviating the need to transport goods to markets in order to acquire capital. Local Celtic artisans demonstrated their resourcefulness by fashioning appropriate coins, as evidenced in the designs of early Roman-era coins. Eventually, coins supplanted body parts in holy well rituals as a manner of granting good fortune. To this day, people continue to toss coins in fountains, adhering to the superstition that such offerings will bring good luck.
