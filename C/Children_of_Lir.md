The tale of the Children of Lir recounts the tragic story of Irish heroine and heroes, which is considered one of the Three Sorrows Of Ireland. The story unfolds as King Lir and the magician’s daughter Áeb enter a joyous marriage and welcome twin son and daughter Áed and Fionnuala. However, their happiness was short-lived, as Áeb died giving birth to twin sons Fiachra and Conn, leaving the four children motherless. Their aunt Aífe, who took charge of the children, became consumed with envy and malice, causing her to cast a wicked spell on them that transformed them into Swans and condemned them to spend nine hundred years in that shape. Although turned into birds, the Children of Lir retained their human feelings and senses, and gained captivating singing voices. When the curse was finally lifted, the four swans rapidly aged, perished, and crumbled to dust in a matter of moments.
