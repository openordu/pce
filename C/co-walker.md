A figure in Irish and Scottish folklore was the co-walker. It was said that shortly before or after someone's death, an exact duplicate of that person could be spotted walking around. A person near death might be seen attending church, while a recently departed man might show up at his own funeral. Some described these duplicates as twin souls, released with death's approach. Others claimed that they were fairies, disguising themselves as the individual standing at the precipice between worlds. It was of utmost importance to never speak to these apparitions or fairies, as they would ultimately vanish and never reappear. However, the nature of the danger was not entirely clear - whether it posed a threat to the living or the deceased.
