Mythic symbol of abundance, the cornucopia originated from the Mediterranean and was adopted by the Celts, who considered abundance to be a significant aspect of their religious beliefs. The horn of plenty was commonly associated with goddesses like Arecura and Epona, but it was also occasionally depicted with images of gods, including Cernunnos.
