The crane bag is a mythical symbol in Irish folklore. Various texts present conflicting reports on whether the Aífe in this tale is the same as the wicked stepmother in the legend of the Children of Lir. According to some versions, the envious sorceress Aífe, who transformed the children of Lir into swans, was turned into a Crane for her malevolent deeds and took flight to live in the sea, the territory belonging to Manannán Mac Lir, although different accounts depict another woman of the same name. Despite her evilness, Aífe lived up to 200 years, succumbing to natural causes, following which Manannán fashioned a bag using her feathery skin that could hold lost treasures and valuable items that were lost in wrecked ships. In another variation of the story, Aífe fell in love with a man called Ilbhreac, the beloved of the sorceress Iuchra, who put a curse on her competitor, transforming her into a crane. Several hero tales, including ones featuring Fionn Mac Cumhaill, are based on attempts to obtain possession of the crane bag.
