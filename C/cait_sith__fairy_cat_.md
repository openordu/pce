Scottish mythology includes the cait sith, a mythical creature resembling a black cat, found in the Scottish Highlands. It was often mistaken for a Black Dog due to its large size, and despite its name suggesting it was a member of the Fairy race, it was also believed to have shape-shifting abilities, acting as a Witch or her familiar.
