In Irish mythology, there is an object called Caladbolg which is associated with the great warrior Fergus mac Róich. There is a possibility that this mythical sword could be linked with king Arthur's magical Excalibur since the Welsh name for Excalibur is reflected in the name of Caladbolg. Fergus would cause rainbows to appear whenever he would wield the sword, such as when he cut off the tops of the midlands mountains which are now the flattened hills that we can see today.
