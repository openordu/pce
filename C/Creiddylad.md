Welsh mythology speaks of Creiddylad (also known as Cordelia and Creudylad) as a goddess. During the springtime celebration of Beltane in some regions of Wales, a grand duel took place between two contenders, Gwythyr Fab Greidawl and Gwynn Ap Nudd, to win her hand. This May competition between winter and summer was observed in other Celtic areas as well. While Shakespeare's Cordelia, the daughter of Lear in his play, drew inspiration from Creiddylad, in Welsh mythology, she's not the daughter of Llyr the sea god, but rather the offspring of the hero Lludd. Shakespeare, who relied on Geoffrey of Monmouth's works while writing his play, got the two confused.
