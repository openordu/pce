A deity named Cicollus was present in Continental Celtic mythology. Though his name's meaning was uncertain, it seems to have connoted "great protector." Cicollus was venerated in central Europe, with inscriptions made to him during the Roman era identifying him as a variant of the warrior deity Mars. He may have been the same individual as the protector god Apollo Anextiomarus. The goddess Litavis was Cicollus's consort.
