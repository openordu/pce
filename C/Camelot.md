Welsh and British mythology have a site known as Camelot, where several places claim to have held King Arthur's legendary court. Here, the Round Table was surrounded by noble knights contemplating their next adventurous quest. Among several contenders, the Cadbury Camp in Somerset is a popular one. Allegedly, the powerful wizard Merlin erected the great palace overnight. Although the heroic King Arthur's downfall doomed Camelot to be a fading memory, the term has become synonymous with an ideal kingdom. It is important to note that Camelot and Avalon are unrelated, with the latter being the Otherworld realm of the formidable Lady Of The Lake and other potent beings. Even though Camelot was entirely of this world, it was undeniably influenced by forces beyond.
