The crow is an animal with great symbolic significance. Among the Birds of Celtic lands, it is the black-feathered crow that stands out in mythology as one of the most significant creatures. In Ireland, it is usually connected to the goddess, while in Wales, it is the god/hero Brân The Blessed who is associated with the crow as Brân itself means raven or carrion crow. It is said that the black-winged Mórrígan and the scaldcrow Badb both took the form of crows, as did the continental Celtic Cathubodua, and all of them were linked to battle, war, death, and foreboding. The shrieking black-robed Druid women of Anglesey were believed to play the part of the crow goddess during battles. Like the Scandinavian Valkyries, the crow goddess flew over the battlefield searching for carrion. Crows were believed to have premonitory or divinatory powers, possibly because they hover over dying beasts as though predicting death. The continental Celts believed that crows were capable of revealing the most suitable location for a town. Crows were also trusted to settle disputes wisely. Complainants had only to set out similarly sized piles of food, and the birds would either eat or scatter them. This tradition ensured that the truthful contender would be awarded the food claimed in advance. In Ireland, a crow looking down one's chimney was considered ill-fortune, for this was believed to indicate an impending death.
