The folklore of the Irish, Scottish, and occasionally Breton regions includes tales of the changeling, a figure associated with fairies. In these tales, fairy babies were born looking like withered little raisinettes, unattractive and more like elderly people than newborns. As a result, many fairy parents were tempted to take plump and jolly human infants and leave their own offspring in their place. To prevent this, there was a strong tradition of protective rituals, such as giving nicknames to children so the fairies could not learn their true names and thus gain power over them. Speedy baptism was also important, as it made a child unattractive to fairies. In place of this, burning old leather shoes in the birthing chamber was deemed a good substitute. If parents discovered their child had been changed, turning from a sweet and calm infant to a bad-tempered, angry brat, there was little recourse but to journey to FairyLAND to try and reclaim the child that had been taken. In some cases, the enchantment of the changeling was so strong that even the parents believed the changed baby was their own. To determine the truth, a test could be administered to the suspected fairy offspring. The suspicious parent would perform an unusual action, such as beating an egg in its shell, rather than in a bowl, or announcing an intention to brew beer from eggs. This would cause confusion to the changeling, which would reveal its true nature by demanding an explanation. Nonetheless, the fairy would remain until the stolen child was found and returned from the Otherworld. Exposing the changeling to the elements was a tactic employed by human parents who sought the return of their children. Unfortunately, such beliefs were sometimes used as justification for abuse and murder of children who were unwanted or disabled. In Wales, the practice was to turn away the said changelings either by exposure to the elements, starvation, or drowning, in the hopes that the fairies would retrieve their lost kin. The fairy changelings were not just infants, as adults who possessed special skills were also taken, including midwives, musicians, and beautiful persons of either gender. In some instances, these individuals were replaced by enchanted stocks of wood. Similar to child changelings, proof exists that people who were believed to have been stolen were subjected to torture and even killed by their own kin. It was still a significant belief in the 19th century as seen from the death of Bridget Cleary who was burned by her family after exhibiting an unexplained illness. This could either mean that the belief was still prevalent or that it was used as a ploy to get rid of a troublesome or ambitious woman in the community. For more information on this, refer to Fairy Kidnapping.
