In the heroic legends of the Fianna, there is a queen who bore the brunt of the Otherworld's powers. Her children were taken away by a long, hairy arm and the queen was left helpless. Fionn Mac Cumhaill came to her aid after she requested him to make a sacred vow called a Geis. He stayed awake throughout the night and managed to catch the Witch Chlaus Haistig who was stealing the queen's children from the roof. Fionn held the witch captive and secured the release of the children who were taken.
