Cú Roí, a renowned Irish hero, held a similar status in Munster as that of Ulster’s famed hero Cúchulainn in the north of Ireland. Scholars suggest that Cú Roí was likely central to an epic cycle, the remnants of which remain tantalizing. Despite his hound-like name, which is common for heroes, the meaning of the latter part of it is unclear, as are his ties to the mythological ancestor known as Díre. Furthermore, Cú Roí’s association with multiple figures named Lugaidh is complex, and he is sometimes referred to as Lugaidh’s son. As a child, Cú Roí demonstrated remarkable fighting skills that continued into adulthood. He went on several adventures, and some sources indicate that he was also king at Tara, thereby subjected to the same Geis as other kings such as Conaire. Together with Cúchulainn, Cú Roí traveled to the Otherworld and seized its treasures, which included the magical woman Bláthnat, three Otherworldly Cows, and a Cauldron of abundance. They agreed to divide the spoils equally, but Cúchulainn broke the deal. As revenge, Cú Roí buried Cúchulainn, leaving only his head sticking out of the ground, shaved his hair off entirely, and covered him with cow dung, thus teaching his partner a lesson. Bláthnat assumed the position of Cú Roí's queen, but her disloyalty became apparent when she joined forces with Cúchulainn, her lover, to plot against her husband. She conveyed to him the sole circumstance that could lead to Cú Roí's death: the destruction of a Salmon, his External Soul. As anticipated, the slaying of this fish resulted in the loss of Cú Roí's power and his subsequent demise. However, Ferchertne, the poet who had remained loyal to Cú Roí, ensured justice was served by grabbing the treacherous queen and leaping off a cliff to his death, taking her with him. Before his ill-fated end, Cú Roí participated in numerous escapades, such as when he became a shepherd to instigate disagreement among Conall Cernach, Lóegure Búadach and Cúchulainn. Cú Roí convinced them to cut off his head, which he then agreed to do the same. After twice receiving the decapitation treatment and being reunited with his body, Conall and Lóegure refused to honor the remainder of the bargain. Cúchulainn was the only person who came through on the promise, volunteering his own neck during the third decapitation, resulting in Cú Roí naming him as the supreme hero. Despite his human Ulster counterpart, Cú Roí seemingly originated as a deity transformed into a hero. His pastimes were conducted within a revolving Otherworld fortress whose entrance disappeared every sunset. Its site is located in the Slieve Mish mountain range of County Kerry or at Temair Luachra, an indeterminate region that could relate to Tara in County Meath. Cú Roí retained his magical Cauldron within that castle, which was large enough to accommodate 30 oxen. These traits of Cú Roí are comparable to those of the fertility deity referred to as the Dagda. An ancestral god of Munster has been identified by some in Cú Roí, while others have recognized a symbol of the sacred ruler who brings prosperity through a just governance (refer to Sacral Kingship).
