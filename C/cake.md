Symbolic in nature, struan or strone cake was a crucial element in the ritualistic celebration of certain feasts. Often referred to as bannock, it served a dual purpose as both an item of festive consumption and as a sacred object. At particular events, the cake would be presented to all those present and offered as a prize to the most skilled athlete or dancer. The winner would then be responsible for breaking and distributing the cake among the attendees. In some instances, one piece of the cake would be deliberately blackened, and whoever was fortunate enough to draw that piece would be deemed "devoted." This peculiar practice may indicate the existence of a longstanding custom of human sacrifice.
