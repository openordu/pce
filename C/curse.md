The power of language was highly regarded by the Celts, who took both blessings and curses very seriously. The responsibility of ensuring a generous and responsible king fell upon the Bard, who held a special power in this regard. If a king proved to be stingy, such as in the case of Bres mac Elatha, the poet would level a curse so dreadful that it would leave the king physically blemished. This would render the king unable to retain his throne, thereby bringing forth a new leader. Noteworthy curses in Celtic mythology include Aífe's curse on her stepchildren, which transformed them into SWANs; her retaliatory curse by the children’s grandfather, the magician Bodb Derg, which transformed Aífe into a Crane; and Macha's curse that brought down the men of Ulster each time they were invaded (Debility Of The UlsterMEN). Counteracting such curses required greater power than the original speaker and was not easily accomplished. Furthermore, the effects of a curse could be long-lasting; for example, Aífe's curse on the Children of Lir persisted for nearly a thousand years. Curses were employed both by humans and divinities. In Ireland, curses were spoken at specific locations such as holy wells or cursing stones, often accompanied by a ritual, such as turning stones counterclockwise against the sun, to disrupt the expected order and bring destruction upon the victim. Piercing apples or potatoes with pins was a common method of causing harm to people in Cornwall. Additionally, it was believed that curses lost their effectiveness if they were spoken out loud instead of being muttered in a low tone.
