Animals that died in unusual ways, such as falling over a cliff or being crushed by a boulder, were referred to as calamity meat, which is an Irish folkloric motif. The belief was that the bodies of such animals were bewitched by Fairies or were the disguised bodies of aged dead fairies left behind when the living animal was taken away. It was thought to be best to bury such animals whole and not cut a steak from their flanks. Before burying them, farmers would puncture the animal's hide with an Iron nail to keep the land where it rested from further fairy influence. Up until recent times, farmers in Scotland and Ireland refused to consume calamity meat out of fear that they might eat a fairy cadaver.
