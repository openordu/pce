The cauldron was a symbolic object in Celtic culture. It served as both a household and sacred item, used for brewing and stewing as well as for the creation of new life. The cauldron held significant power for the Celts. According to the Roman author Strabo, the Celts sent a sacramental cauldron to Caesar Augustus that was used for the ritual killing of prisoners. This type of ritual could have been the reason behind the creation of the Gundestrup Cauldron. This large silver vessel, although found in Denmark and not typically considered as Celtic territory, features mythological figures including Cernunnos and an unidentified giant goddess, as well as interlacing abstract designs, thus indicating it could have been a Celtic product. Smaller cauldrons have been discovered in bogs and lakes, seemingly dedicated to Otherworld powers as offerings. The cauldron symbolized abundance and fullness with Ireland's "good god," the Dagda, having a cauldron that never emptied of good things, while the Welsh goddess Ceridwen used hers to cook up a broth that bestowed wisdom to its drinkers ( see Taliesin). However, even abundance and plenty could be mishandled. In the Welsh Mabinogion, there was a cauldron of rebirth, originally from Ireland, where the bodies of soldiers were submerged to bring them back to life without their souls, so they could return to battle again.
