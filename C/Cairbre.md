Male heroes of legendary significance in Irish history bore the common name Cairbre (or Carbry, Carpre, Cairpre, Corpre). Cairbre himself is the name borne by several characters of note: Cairbre mac Éadaoine (also known as Corpre mac Étaine) was a poet. His mother was the poet Étan and his father was Ogma, god of eloquence. When Cairbre visited Tara, the royal residence, he anticipated the hospitality appropriate for a bard, but instead was shut into a poor dwelling and served only stale bread. As he considered the ruler Bres mac Elatha to be stingy, Cairbre composed a Satire which raised sores on Bres' face; due to his blemished appearance, Bres was forced to abdicate his position. In the second battle of Mag Tuired, Cairbre’s magical poetic power aided the Tuatha Dé Danann in their victory. When Cairbre passed away, his mother was so heartbroken that she too died. Another Cairbre was Cairbre Cinn-Chait (catcheann), or “Cat-head,” who seized the throne of Tara by ambushing and murdering its heirs. However, as unjust rulers were prohibited from overseeing productive lands in Ireland, his reign was brief, and rightful rule soon returned. Lastly, Cairbre Lifechair (of the Coffey) was a high king. Cairbre was so upset by having to pay taxes for his daughter’s wedding, that he waged war upon the wandering heroes of the Fianna. This resulted in the destruction of that legendary fighting force, but also led to Cairbre’s death, which occurred at the renowned battle of Gabhair. Famed for his twelve beautiful daughters, Cairbre Nia Fer was a opposition king of Tara who met his end at the hand of Cúchulainn.
