Crobh Dearg, also known as Crove Derg, was an Irish goddess hailing from the southwestern Province of Munster. She was sometimes believed to be the sister of Latiaran, a Christianized god, and Creidne, a regional goddess, in addition to the revered local saint, Gobnat. Potentially, Crobh Dearg was a manifestation of Badb. Her connection to a sacred Well, situated on or near the famous Paps Of Danu, was integral to her identity. The local procedure entailed visiting the well and the following Fairy Mound, Cahercrovdarrig, on Beltane. Until relatively recently, cattle from the surrounding area were brought to the well to be purified.
