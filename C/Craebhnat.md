In the southwestern Province of Munster near Doneraile, there was a sacred tree devoted to Craebhnat (or Creevna), an Irish heroic figure. The story goes that when she was pressured into marriage, she tore out an eye in the hope of discouraging her suitor. The tree itself was a magical Irish Ash tree. There was another tree close by that supposedly had the power to keep individuals afloat; those who possessed even the slightest piece of the bark or wood would never sink. It is uncertain whether the locals viewed Craebhnat as one of the Saints or as a Fairy.
