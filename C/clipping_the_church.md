Performing a circle dance around the churchyard while touching the walls of the church was a ritual in some village churches in England, known as clipping the church. The act drew attention to the ancient holy sites on which churches were often erected (see Christianity), and it is believed that the ritual might have been related to a former practice of touching stones in a stone circle by celebrants. The celebration of this rite in the Cotswolds occurred during the Autumnal Equinox, when the Yews in the churchyard were clipped.
