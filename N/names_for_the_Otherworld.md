Numerous names describe the Otherworld, a Celtic paradise found in folkloric tradition. The Otherworld was not subjected to the same taboo against speaking of Fairies, yet there are still many vivid names that evoke it. Examples are Ildathach, which means “many-coloured land”; Mag Mór, the “great plain”; Mag Mell, the “plain of honey”; Mag Mon, the “plain of sports”; Mag Réin, or “plain of the sea”; Tir Fo Thuinn, or the “land under wave”; Tir Na Nog, the “land of youth”; Tir Na Mban, the “land of women”; and Tir Tairngiri, the “land of promise.” These names occasionally refer to a particular realm in the Otherworld, such as the floating island occupied by the great Fairy Queen Niamh of the Golden Hair. Nevertheless, they are usually interchangeable.
