Nechtan, also known as Elcmar, was a god or hero in Irish mythology. He played a part in the tale of Bóand, a goddess whose river, the Boyne, originated near a small Hillfort known as Síd Nechtain, or “the Fairy Mound of Nechtan”. Though not as well-known as Nuada, Nechtan was believed to have resided in the Brú Na Bóinne, a large stone tumulus, with his spouse Bóand. However, Bóand tricked him as she desired to be with the powerful and well-endowed Dagda. To hide their affair, the Dagda made the sun stand still for nine months, enabling their child to be delivered before Nechtan discovered the betrayal. Nechtan was later tricked again by their son Aonghus Óg, who claimed that he alone had not received a fairy palace and therefore deserved the Brú na Bóinne. Consequently, Nechtan was forced to leave and settled in another fairy hill near the Boyne's source. Some legends indicate that Nechtan transformed into a Salmon, although the figure is often known as Find or Fintan. The Salmon resided near the magical Hazel trees and survived on the nuts of Wisdom that fell from them. If anyone caught and consumed the Salmon, they would obtain all its wisdom. Nechtan has been linked to the continental Celtic god Nodens, whose shrine in Britain displayed sculptures of hooked fish.
