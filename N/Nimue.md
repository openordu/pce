Nimue, an Arthurian heroine with a Welsh name, is a mysterious figure known as the Lady of the Lake. She sponsored king Arthur from the Otherworld, residing on an Island of women located in the fairy mists. Sometimes, Nimue is referred to as the lover of magician Merlin, who appears as Arthur's half-sister Morgause. Morgause, in turn, has been assumed to be the Lady of the Lake. Confusingly, some texts call Merlin's lover Viviane. Oral transmission of mythologies and imaginative writing has resulted in the commonplace occurrence of such confusions. According to a common tale, Nimue, daughter of the Roman goddess Diana, was raised in the forest, Merlin met her there for the first time. Her first request of him was to teach her to make a tower out of thin air, which he did. However, he was unaware that his life would end when she later created such a prison for him.
