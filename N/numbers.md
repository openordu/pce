Celtic culture attributed to numbers a mysterious and powerful nature, even something magical. The most important numbers were Three and Five, but others had their significance. The highest number in the Celtic numerical system was ten, which corresponds to the numbers of fingers in both hands. Larger numbers were expressed in multiples (10 times 10) or described as a "vast" or "innumerable" army. Old Irish sources suggest a five-based counting system, reflected in mythology and family organization. Although no written evidence of a numerological system assigning mystical meanings to specific numbers exists, some numbers recurred so frequently that it is reasonable to assume such beliefs. The repetition of the numbers three and five in various mythological contexts is particularly strong evidence for such numerology, which is no longer evident. Repeatedly occurring numbers suggest the following meanings: Two is connected with service or commitment, found in legends of enchanted women chained together in pairs, in pairs of oracular Ravens accompanying the hero Cúchulainn, and in the two loyal hunting Dogs of Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Four is connected with wholeness, as the hidden fifth is implied (see Provinces), and four is seen as a diminished version of five. Seven is associated with magic and may have been influenced by non-Celtic, possibly Middle Eastern sources; the most common usage shows typical Celtic multiplication, in which the Seventh Son of a seventh son (less frequently, the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter) was particularly likely to be magically gifted. Myths often involve transformations that occur over a period of seven years. For instance, the goddess Étain had to endure a seven-year period of living as an insect, and every seven years, the enchanted Lough Gur recedes to expose its hidden mysteries.
