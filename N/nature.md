In her depictions, Natosuelta, a Celtic goddess, is not depicted in the midst of nature, but instead holding a pot, which could be interpreted as a holder of river water or an indication of her association with the household. This is supported by her occasional invocation as a protector of the home and hearth. Some images also portray Natosuelta carrying a house on a pole with a raven sitting on top, a common symbol of prophecy. A shrine dedicated to her was constructed at the Roman settlement of Ad Pontem, currently known as East Stoke in Nottinghamshire. Here, she is shown alongside an unnamed male deity. On the continent, she is often associated with Sucellus, a god known as "the striker."
