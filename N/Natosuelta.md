Deity Natosuelta (Nantosuelta) was a goddess of the Continental Celtic origin. Her appellation has been interpreted to signify both “winding brook” and “meandering river”, both which underline her dominion over fresh water. Her power likely extended over the terrain of her watershed, namely the River Trent of Britain, akin to other Celtic River goddesses. The depictions of this goddess under Roman influence do not accentuate her association with rivers.
