An Irish goddess named Nemain, also called Neman or Neamhan, was one of the three Mórrígna - a trio of war goddesses. Nemain was not as prominent as Badb, who was known as “scald crow” and Mórrígan, who was referred to as “great queen” or “queen of phantoms”. However, Nemain's name suggested that she was the goddess of “battle panic” or “frenzy of war”. She had the ability to make warriors so frenzied that they sometimes mistook their allies for enemies, leading to tragedies known as “friendly fire”. Although she was briefly described in various documents as confusing warriors with her weird cries, like other war goddesses, Nemain was believed to take the form of a crow, hovering over battlefields like other carrion eaters waiting for their next meal. As her name might be connected to the Celtic term for an outdoor shrine, Nemeton, she could symbolize the obligation of warriors to safeguard sacred sites.
