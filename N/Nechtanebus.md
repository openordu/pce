Irish lineage traces back to Nechtanebus, who supposedly ruled over Egypt and that through his daughter Scota, the Irish people descend from him. Scota wedded Míl, the itinerant soldier, whose offspring, the Milesians, are considered the last group to settle in Ireland. This story comes from the Book of Invasions, a mythological historic text, that most experts regard as unreliable. Even though there is skepticism, many pharaohs named Nechtanebus existed, and it appears that the title of the hero or god Nechtan is derived from this name.
