Nehalennia was a Continental Celtic goddess who held a significant place among the gods worshipped in the Netherlands. Despite being a goddess of great prominence, there are no surviving literary accounts of her as a deity. The reason for her obscurity in contemporary texts is that her mythology was lost to us over time. The only available sources of information about her are the many sculptures and images dedicated to her, with their intricate and remarkably consistent iconography. Archaeologists have unearthed two noteworthy temple sites dedicated to Nehalennia, both of which were located near the North Sea. At one site, near the town of Domberg on the Island of Walcheren, a huge temple emerged from the sea on January 5, 1647, after a storm battered the seacoast. The temple, which dated back to the second or third century C.E., was mostly destroyed by fire in 1848, but it originally contained more than two dozen altars and other monuments made with stone from as far away as Metz, over 400 miles from the temple site. Records of the excavation indicate that many artifacts, such as pottery and coins, were discovered on the site, revealing that there was significant commercial activity taking place there. Nehalennia's temple was quite elaborate and it is evident that she held special significance for seafaring traders who stopped at this port to buy provisions, engage in commerce, and pay homage to her. Her followers believed that her blessings and power extended over their activities, and they showed their admiration for her by lavishing wealth and gifts upon her shrine. A new shrine devoted to the goddess Nehalennia was discovered in 1979 near Colijnsplaat in the Oosterschelde estuary. The discovery was made by a local fisherman who found fragments of altars to the goddess. Following the discovery, almost 100 artifacts were found in the area, which is believed to be Ganuenta, a temple that sank beneath the estuary during the late Roman period. The statuary, inscriptions, and other artifacts found in these two locations have established Nehalennia as the most significant deity worshipped by the Celtic inhabitants of this region, despite the lack of information about her mythology. Initially, the goddess was believed to be the ancestral goddess of the Morini tribe, but she ultimately became worshipped by seafarers and sailing crews who frequented the area. These seagoers made offerings to the goddess for protection during their treacherous journeys on the North Sea, where her worship was particularly pronounced. Subsequently, Nehalennia has become prominent in the iconography of the region with elements featuring boats, oars, rudders, shells, fish, dolphins, and sea monsters being particularly evident. She was generally depicted as a robust young woman, often dressed in a cape and round cap, which have been interpreted as a local costume. Although typically shown as seated, she was sometimes depicted standing with one foot on the prow of a ship or pulling a boat by a rope. Translations of Nehalennia's name describe her as a "leader" and the "woman who steers," indicating that her role as a goddess of seafarers was symbolic, rather than literal. A deity who safely guides her followers to an Otherworld after death, Nehalennia has been described as a goddess of death. The Celts envisioned this Otherworld as an Island somewhere out in the western sea. In her most prevalent depictions, Nehalennia is accompanied by an alert and large dog, which has been interpreted as a guardian of the dead. This canine guardian sits beside her feet with a kindly rather than fierce expression on its face, appearing more like a watchful guard dog than a pet. The goddess was not only connected to the sea but also to the land's productiveness. She was often represented surrounded by symbols of abundance, including baskets of produce and grain, and a full Cornucopia. Many of her altars had sculpted images of heaped fruits, indicating that they had been placed there as an offering. No image of Nehalennia has been discovered without fruit or vegetables surrounding her. Therefore she seemed unconcerned with human or animal fecundity, instead of focusing on the vegetative world. As a goddess of commerce, Nehalennia would have overseen the ships filled with grain that were part of the trade during the ancient times, invoking her for a good harvest could result in good profits. However, this imagery may have had a less selfish motivation since Nehalennia may have been seen as a goddess of the world's journey through the seasons. Cosmic symbols like the Sun and the Moon are depicted on some of Nehalennia's altars, indicating that her impact went beyond trade and encompassed various forms of prosperity and abundance in both the physical and spiritual realms.
