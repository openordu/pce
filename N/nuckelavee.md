A Scottish folklore tale that has been passed down over time is that of the nuckelavee. This monstrous creature was known to terrorize the people of Orkney, which are a chain of islands located in the northeast of Scotland. It was half-human, half-horse with a single eye and a body like that of a Red-fleshed Horse, except it had flippers instead of legs. This creature resided in the sea and would leap out to attack both humans and cattle whenever it pleased. However, there was a way to avoid this monster's wrath, by crossing a body of fresh water, which it could not tolerate. Some believe that the nuckelavee is closely related to the more commonly known Water Horse, or even the Nygel of Shetland.
