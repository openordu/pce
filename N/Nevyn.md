This account is of the Welsh mythical character, Nevyn, a captivating Mermaid from Wales. She was the cherished partner of Ivan Morgan, a young man who resided on the coast of Carnavonshire. Similar to other beings of her kind, she was an excellent spouse, both devoted and sensuous to her human counterpart. The couple had a son and a daughter, Nevydd and Eilonwy respectively, and they lived contentedly until Nevyn began to yearn for her underwater homeland where she had grown up. When her mother and father journeyed to the Otherworld below the waves, their son, Nevydd, discovered his true lineage and perished from embarrassment. In response, Eilonwy attempted suicide, hurling herself into the water. However, she was saved from drowning by a dashing merman prince who took her to live with him in the magical Otherworld below the sea. Nevyn returned to the land to retrieve the remains of her son, whom she took with her on an enchanting ship that appeared spontaneously. Unfortunately, the legend remains silent regarding the fate of the grieving Ivan. Interestingly, the name of Nevyn's son, Nevydd, is comparable to that of the Irish Fairy Queen, Niamh of the Golden Hair, implying that they may have been one and the same entity.
