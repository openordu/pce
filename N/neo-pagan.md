A religion known as neo-pagan (or neo-Pagan) has emerged, which seeks to rebuild ancient religions to fit the present world. Those who belong to this group attempt to recreate traditions that have been passed down in secrecy for many generations, although there is little evidence supporting these assertions. They may instead point to the combination of beliefs from Celtic religion, Christianity, and pre-Celtic religions that have been present in European areas for generations and persist even today, despite being derided as superstitions. Additionally, some practitioners do not make such claims of secret knowledge but instead describe their faith as a reconstruction of ancient beliefs. The Celtic Revival includes both individual practitioners as well as groups who identify within both categories.
