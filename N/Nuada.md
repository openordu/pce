Nuada, the Irish God, was the leader of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the people of the goddess Danu, during their struggle for control over Ireland with the malevolent Fomorians. Nuada was an excellent leader and a great warrior until he lost his arm or hand in the first battle of Mag Tuired. This injury caused him to forfeit his throne as a king with a disability could not rule. After him, a Blemished King named Bres replaced him but proved to be such a miser that he was overthrown for his offense against Hospitality, for he did not feed the poet Cairbre. Cairbre subjected him to Satire causing boils to form on his face, rendering him too blemished to rule, thereby losing him his realm. Meanwhile, the healing god Dian Cécht crafted a silver arm for Nuada, but it was still an impediment to his kingship. Then Dian Cécht's son, Miach, a brilliant physician, caused skin to grow over the silver arm, thereby restoring Nuada's right to rule. However, Miach was killed by Dian Cécht out of envy for his accomplishments. When the Tuatha Dé Danann left the surface of the earth to live in their magical swellings or sidhe, Nuada became the king of Almu, an early ritualistic site and significant magical center within the Province of Leinster. His palace has been placed in various locations by different sources. Some claim it to be the Brú Na Bóinne, a great tumulus on the River Boyne, and state that he was the consort of the goddess of the area, Bóand. He was deceived twice by Bóand; first, with the god Dagda, and then later by their son Aonghus Óg who tricked him out of his grand palace. Nechtan, who is sometimes referred to as Bóand's betrayed husband, is believed to be an alternative name for Nuada. Nuada was once elevated from divine status and portrayed as a human king who fought against Fionn Mac Cumhaill for dominance over Leinster. In Almu, one of the treasures of his race was held by Nuada, which was a legendary sword that could not be sheathed once unsheathed. There is also a minor figure with this name, who was a human Druid serving King Cathaír Mór.
