British god Nodens (Nodons) remains relatively enigmatic. According to the invading Romans, he was equivalent to their warrior god, Mars. Located in Gloucestershire on the Severn River, Lydney boasts a grand temple dedicated to Nodens, inclusive of a dormitory and various sites for healing. It is possible that Nodens was worshipped as a healer, fighting against disease. Nodens is linked to Silvanus, the woodland god, which suggests that the Celts believed healing worked best in a natural setting. Despite having no human form, Nodens is believed to have been represented as a large dog - typically a symbol of healing for the Celts, although also viewed as a protector of the deceased. A number of canine sculptures featured in the deity's sanctuaries may have symbolized Nodens' attendants. The translation of Nodens' name is uncertain, but may mean "cloud-maker," "wealth-producer," or "fisherman." Nodens is deemed one of the most important Celtic gods of Britain due to the significance of his sanctuary. He is often compared to the similarly named Irish god, Nuadu, and has been potentially tied to the Welsh god, Lludd, who is also known as Nudd.
