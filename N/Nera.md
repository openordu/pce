An Irish hero named Nera (Neara mac Niadhain) features in one of the outstanding literary and mythological texts of Ireland, the Adventure of Nera. The narrative unfolds at Cruachan, the grand palace of the goddessqueen Medb of Connacht, on the magical night of Samhain (November 1), the Celtic festival that was thought to open the doors to the Otherworld. A request came from King Ailill mac Máta to attend to a hanged body, which Nera volunteered to undertake. The dead man, surprisingly, spoke to him and requested water. Nera proceeded to carry the corpse on his back in search of it, only to witness the palace in flames upon turning towards it. He followed the arsonists to Oweynagat's cave and discovered that he had envisioned an attack that would take place the next year on Samhain. The woman who gave him this information became Nera's Otherworld spouse, but he went back to Cruachan to warn Medb and Ailill of the anticipated attack before settling down with her. Subsequently, the queen and king raided Oweynagat, overpowering the army that had planned on burning their residence. However, Nera's exploits were far from over, as the great war goddess Mórrígan stole a cow from the herd belonging to his Fairy wife, and took it to the upper world to breed it with the great Donn Cuailnge, the finest brown Bull in Ireland. The calf that was born engaged in a battle with Finnbennach, the white bull of Connacht, in which the latter killed the young bull. Overhearing someone say that the outcome of a battle would have been different if the father of a calf had fought instead, Medb made a vow to witness such a battle someday. Her wish was granted after she carried out her raid on Ulster, an event chronicled in the Irish epic "Táin Bó Cuailnge".
