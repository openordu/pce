The Celts may have practiced necromancy, which involves communicating with or reviving the deceased to gain their knowledge. Though folktales suggest that Witches or Fairies had this capability, it remains uncertain whether ordinary people could also do it. However, the Irish have a record of a lengthy ritual performed by a Bard who used necromancy to attain knowledge. Senchan Torpeist prepared for days, engaging in Magic, to summon the spirit of Fergus mac Róich, a heroic figure who died and joined others in the afterlife. The bard succeeded in performing the challenging task, reciting the lost verses of the great Irish epic, Táin Bó Cuailnge, to an assembly of other poets. He then died from the exhaustion caused by the effort.
