Nemetona is a Continental Celtic and British goddess whose name comes from Nemeton, the Celtic term for "sacred grove". For the Celts, worship was done outdoors, primarily in groves of trees that symbolized the holiness of nature. "She of the sacred grove" or "the goddess of the shrine" are some of the possible translations for Nemetona's name, which might be connected with the Nemetes, a Germanic tribe, whose ancestral goddess she could have been. There is a linguistic connection between Nemetona and the Irish war-goddess Nemain, indicating that part of a warrior's role may have been to safeguard sacred locations. In parts of Gaul, it appears that Nemetona was treated as a god instead of a goddess.
