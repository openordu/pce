The Celts were known for conducting their religious ceremonies outdoors in sacred sites such as groves of trees. The nemeton, which was a sacred forest clearing, was a popular location for these rituals. The word nemeton is believed to be related to other Indo-European language words such as Greek n√©mos, which referred to a glade, and Latin nemus, which signified something sacred. This Celtic word may even be traced back to the ancient Irish root, nem-, which denoted "heaven" but symbolically referred to anything sacred. Classical authors noted the outdoor locations of these Celtic rituals, especially in the oak groves where Galacians were known to meet, according to Strabo. Similarly, Pliny the Elder and Tacitus spoke of continental Celts and their rituals in the forest groves. Lucan provided a vivid description of the groves, declaring that they were "untouched by men's hands from ancient times, whose interlacing boughs enclosed a space of darkness and cold shade," filled with "images of gods grim and rude [made] of felled tree-trunks." Although these groves were considered sacred, they were sometimes destroyed by fire, earthquakes, or by Caesar himself, who leveled one in the name of Roman construction. As a result of Romanization, the word nemeton was sometimes applied to stone temples that took the place of these sacred groves. Today, many Celtic settlements bear this word in their name such as Drunemeton in Turkey, Nematacum and Nemeton in Gaul, Nemetobrigia in Galacia, Vernemeton in England, and Medionemeton in Scotland.
