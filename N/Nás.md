Nás (Naas) was an Irish goddess or heroine who was only known as the wife of Lugh, a great hero. Nás is still remembered today in Ireland because Naas, a prosperous town near Dublin, is said to be the location of her death or burial. An ancient demand called Buada required the king at Tara to dine on Hares from Naas, which is why the town is called Naas na Rí, which means “Naas of the Kings.” It is believed that Lugh established the great assembly of Teltown in honor of Nás, though this festival is more commonly said to have been organized to honor his foster mother, the goddess Tailtiu.
