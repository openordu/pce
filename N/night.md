Cosmology played a significant role in Celtic traditions. Unlike the conventional way of commencing the day with dawn, the Celts believed a new day started at sundown of the previous day. Therefore, Celtic festivals were observed during the evening of what we now know as the day before. Hallowe'en, derived from the Celtic feast of Samhain, is still celebrated at sundown on October 31, and Beltane celebrations originated from May Eve festivities on April 30.
