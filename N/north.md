The direction known as north or tuasiceart held the most negative connotations for the ancient Irish and potentially for other Celts. According to their observations, the Sun seemed to move towards the south on a regular basis, as if running away from the north, which was considered to be the opposite direction from its position during noon. Since the sunrise direction, known as deosil, was associated with correctness and natural order, moving to the left or towards the north had opposing meanings. In current Irish language, words related to north have negative associations, evident in words like "foreboding," "curse," and "anguish," which all originate from the word "north." Ulster, the northern province, is primarily linked to war in ancient epics.
