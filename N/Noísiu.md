Noísiu or Naeshe, Naisii, Naoise, Noise, Noaise was a remarkable Irish hero. The lore surrounding this young man, one of the Sons Of Uisneach and lover of the charming heroine Deirdre represents one of Ireland's most romantic and tragic legends. Deirdre was held hostage by the king of Ulster, Concobar Mac Nessa against a prophecy that doomed her to be immensely beautiful and the cause of war. Although raised without ever having seen a man, Deirdre dreamed of Noísiu's existence. Once she saw a Raven’s feather and blood on snow, and she wished aloud to have a man with hair that black, lips that red, skin that white. Leborcham, her nurse, introduced her to Noísiu, the man who fit her description. Together with his brothers, Ardán and Ainnle, Noísiu eloped with Deirdre, running from the powerful king Concobar who pursued them relentlessly. Finally, they found peace in the wilderness of Scotland, where they lived a hard but healthy life until Concobar lured them back with promises of forgiveness. Deirdre sensed treachery, but Noísiu longed for home. Nonetheless, as soon as they arrived, Concobar had Noísiu and his brothers killed. However, Deirdre prevented him from taking her by committing suicide in grief over the loss of her true love, Noísiu. Although Uisneach was an obscure man, Noísiu and his brothers were his children, and some argue that there is a connection with the mythological site of Uisneach in Co. Elbha, daughter of the notorious druid Cathbad, was the mother of the Westmeath boys. According to legend, they could have been half-siblings to King Concobar. This is because Cathbad is said to have fathered the king with Assa, a peaceful scholar who became the warrior Nessa after being attacked by Cathbad and his household.
