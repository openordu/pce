Fire played a significant role in Celtic culture as it was seen as the essence of life, a potent symbol by the people. Fire festivals were held several times a year, possibly starting with agricultural tribes to clear forests of brushwood and burn cultivated fields; these rituals later gained solar symbolism with mythological importance. These festivals included extinguishing all household fires, throughout belief which held that a new life was given to the earth during the Beltane Festival through the sacred fire, in Ireland and the Isle of Man. Celtic people believed that intercession from gods and ancestral spirits was necessary to deal with famine, diseases, or when witchcraft was suspected. For such cases, a need-fire ritual was performed, regardless of the season or date. Celebrants, designated by the Druids in the past, the primary fire was made using a wooden fire-wheel or flint, and from it, local households would relight their hearth fires. Certain types of wood were believed to have spiritual power, requiring this wood to be rubbed together to generate a spark for the need-fire. The need-fire had complex rituals connected to it, including capturing a spark in a piece of hemp. The hemp would light a candle, which would, in turn, light a torch, finally igniting a pile of peat or turf bricks. See Beltane. Married men were sometimes exclusively allowed to handle the wooden fire-stakes that were used in a ritualistic manner to suggest sexual symbolism to fire-making. This practice was believed to be limited by the marital status of the men involved. The ritual was sometimes enhanced with the inclusion of water, and a Cauldron was placed over the fire to create a boiling concoction that was then sprinkled over homes, people, herds, and anything else that needed protection. Women who were expecting children were sometimes the beneficiaries of what were known as need-fires. These fires were lit specifically to protect the expectant mothers and infants from being kidnapped by fairies. As part of the protection ritual, a blazing brand would be carried around the house or herd to purify and shield it from harm. The need-fire tradition lasted a long time in the Celtic regions, dating back centuries. In 1767, on the Scottish island of Mull, a need-fire was reportedly lit because a cattle disease was wreaking havoc on the local stock. Despite the local Christian ministers demonizing the practice as "wicked," people climbed the hill of Carnmoor with a wheel and spindles made of oak, which was a sacred tree for the Celts. All visible fires were put out, and the fire-wheel was spun in a sunwise direction until sparks flew from it. As witnesses observed the event, they chanted an incantation whose words were not recorded. Per the legend, the sun's energy was growing stronger until noon, explaining why the wheel had to create fire before midday. For three days in a row, they spun the wheel but didn't produce enough sparks, so they waited until the next day. When the need-fire finally sparked, they brought a diseased heifer and sacrificed her, burning the diseased part in the fire. All the fires across the region were then lit from the need-fire, and they roasted the rest of the animal as a sacrificial feast to share. Jacob Grimm, the renowned folklorist, documented the need-fire ritual practiced by both Germanic and Celtic people. It's not known which civilization first practiced the rite, and which adapted it from the other.
