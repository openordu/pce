A god called Nemglan features in just one Irish myth. This is the tale of Mess Buachalla, a heroine whom Nemglan, assuming the form of a bird, seduced. The couple had a son named Conaire, the king of Tara. Conaire was instructed not to harm birds, given his lineage, which led some academics to posit an ancient concept of animal totems. Nemglan visited Conaire ahead of his inauguration as king and divulged the undisclosed criteria for his appointment and flourishing.
