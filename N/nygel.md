A Scottish folkloric figure known as Nygel, also spelled as Noggle or Nuggle, has been mentioned in the Shetland Islands' mythology. It was known to appear as a charming gray pony, but upon mounting, one must be cautious as it can take them on a speedy ride towards the sea, eventually dunking them there. Unlike the fatal Water Horse, Nygel was less menacing in terms of attacks. It is believed to be a variant of the Water Horse and is considered less threatening than the neighboring Monster, the Nuckelavee. Nygel's fondness for millraces - streams running from old water-powered grain and woolen mills - was quite evident. It grew angry if the streams were left running accidentally at night, forcing the wheel to a stop and wreaking havoc on the machinery, punishing those who were responsible for it.
