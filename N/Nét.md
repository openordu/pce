Obscure to the contemporary world, Nét (also known as Néit) was an Irish deity who was believed to be the spouse of Nemain, the goddess of war. Nét was presumably a war god; however, he could also be the same figure as Nemed, the husband of Macha, a goddess who is at times mistakenly identified with Nemain. It is rare to find Celtic war gods as Celtic regions were typically controlled by goddesses. Accounts regarding Nét are inconsistent, as some recognize him as a member of the monstrous Fomorians while others claim that he was one of the magical Tuatha Dé Danann. Nét is often linked to the Irish locale Grianán Aileach, a grand stone fortress in the far northern reaches of the island whose mythological importance is indisputable, although its significance is open to interpretation.
