    "text": "A Scottish spirit known as the kelpie was believed to be responsible for storms at sea in Scotland. These mischievous beings, sometimes appearing as blue men, were also known to take the form of a Water Horse. The Blue Men Of The Minch were known to make waters constantly turbulent, impeding navigation, while other kelpies would only stir up trouble when they wanted to cause distress. Even a smooth river or pond could become treacherous if a traveler stepped into it. Kelpies were known to leap up onto horses passing over fords, creating panic in the horses and endangering the riders. Malevolent kelpies could seize control of boats, but skippers could force them away by reciting rhyming couplets. Some people have likened kelpies to the Breton Korrigan, but the latter is often portrayed as a lustful maiden, while the kelpie is not considered as highly sexed."
