    "text": "A site that is commonly associated with mythology is the spring. Distinguishing wells and springs may prove difficult, as both serve comparable purposes in myth and legend, while also providing similar sources of freshwater. The belief that both possess healing powers, even from a distance, was widespread. Consequently, water obtained from a holy well or sacred spring could aid someone in need who found it too inconvenient to travel there. Thermal springs (also known as \u201chot springs\u201d) were particularly powerful, where the warmth of the waters (sometimes to the point of being blisteringly hot) served as a relaxant for people from earlier times. Up until the Roman period, people flocked in droves to the thermal spring at Bath, seeking solace for their physical as well as emotional pain. Several scholars have suggested that pre-Celtic peoples also utilized these locations, which could imply that the rituals performed there arose from diverse religions combining. The earlier people may have viewed the places as openings to the womb of the earth mother, but the Celtic heritage seems apparent from the link between water and abundance, fertility, and wellness, which is present throughout the Celtic world."
