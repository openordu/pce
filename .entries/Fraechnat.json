    "text": "One of the heroines or goddesses in Irish mythology was Fraechnat. The Dindshenchas, a placelore, stated that she was among the women who came with the first wave of invaders to Ireland and died later. Her final resting place is said to be on top of a mountain, Slieve Fraech, which bears her name. Interestingly, Fraechnat was not included on the list of companions that Cesair brought with her, as recorded in the Book Of Invasions. It is therefore possible that she was a deity from the local area whose story was adapted into the tale."
