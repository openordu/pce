    "text": "Celtic lands have long honored boulders and pebbles with holes in them as healing stones. This tradition dates back to the Megalithic Civilization and may have even existed in pre-Celtic times. In Brittany, it was believed that passing a newborn through the hole in the healing stone at Fouvent-le-Haut would protect them from childhood ailments and malevolent Witch spells. Similar rituals were carried out in Amance, where money was tossed through a Holed Stone as an alternative means of protection. In Cornwall, the round rock at Men-An-Tol was thought to prevent and cure rheumatic diseases if one crawled naked through it or was pushed through it while reciting a magical spell a certain number of times, typically either three or nine. England also has examples of similar rites, such as the Long Stone in Gloucestershire that was said to cure measles, whooping cough, and other contagious diseases among children. The Tolmen, a large holed stone in Dartmoor, was another example that could cure arthritis if one could safely drop through it into the North Teign River below. Ireland had Cloch-a-Phoill in Co. Carlow where children with the limbtwisting vitamin deficiency called rickets were passed through in hopes of finding a cure. Moreover, there was a huge (10\u00d79 foot) stone located at a triple crossroads in Co. Sligo, known as either Clochbhreach (Speckled Stone) or Clochlia (Gray Stone), which has a small (2\u00d73 foot) natural perforation. Children with measles were passed through this hole, and these holed stones were considered to be especially effective healers and revered throughout Scotland and England. An Irish rock located in Northumberland was believed to have healing powers that were only effective when applied by someone with Irish ancestry. To preserve its potency, it was never allowed to touch English soil. Stitch-stones were used in Scotland to alleviate chronic illnesses and skin conditions. Once an individual was healed using the stones, they kept them until someone else needed them. The most recently affected person delivered the stones for use. The Stones of Stenness, found on Orkney, were thought to have the ability to cure various ailments if one walked around them three times deosil, or clockwise, following the direction of the Sun."
