    "text": "A circle of a darker green on a grassy field is a folkloric motif known as a fairy ring, which is thought to have been created by fairies engaging in their circle dances around their queen. These fairy rings were believed to have an enchantment even when they were not being used as dance floors by the fairies. As a result, livestock were prohibited from grazing on them, and they were safeguarded from the plow as well. Numerous accounts exist of cattle being struck by plagues after farmers inadvertently or deliberately permitted their herds to graze on a fairy ring. In addition, other stories suggest that individuals who ventured into a fairy ring unknowingly or arrogantly would begin dancing frenetically without the ability to stop; some even danced themselves to death. The only way to save the unfortunate dancer was for someone outside of the circle to take hold of clothing that extended beyond the boundary of the circle since anyone who reached into it would experience the same frenzy to dance."
