    "text": "Irish hero Searbhan, also known as Sharvon the Surly, Sharvan, and Searban, assisted the lovers Gr\u00e1inne and Diarmait in their escape. He was a giant and magician who allowed them to take refuge in his Rowan tree. Despite being warned by Searbhan not to consume the mystical berries, Gr\u00e1inne was still tempted and requested Diarmait to acquire them for her. In order to do so, Diarmait killed Searbhan. Unfortunately, this caused the giant to scream in agony, revealing their whereabouts to Fionn Mac Cumhaill, who was pursuing them."
