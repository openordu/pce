    "text": "The Loathy Lady, a revolting and unattractive character in certain Arthurian legends, is actually a manifestation of the ancient goddess of Sovereignty. According to the tales, the Hag would transform into a beautiful young woman when kissed by the rightful king. She is also reminiscent of the pre-Celtic figure of the Cailleach, who controlled the weather. In some Grail legends, the Loathy Lady would test the purity of candidates by asking them enigmatic questions. Referred to as both Cundrie and Lady Ragnell, this character served as an inspiration to Geoffrey Chaucer for his \u201cWife of Bath\u2019s Tale.\u201d"
