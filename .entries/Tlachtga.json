    "text": "Tlachtga, a significant Irish mythological site, is located near Athboy in Co. Meath. Though it is less popular than the nearby hill of Tara, it is celebrated for its deep-rooted mythological significance as the spot of the grand \u00d3enach or assembly of Samhain, the festival of winter\u2019s arrival on November 1. The festival has become famous as Halloween in the modern era. Tlachtga, also recognized as the Hill of Ward, holds enormous historical significance, with remarkable earthworks from the Celtic era. The place's prominence lasted till historical times as in the year 1168, the high king Rory O\u2019Connor convened an all-island assembly there. Tlachtga rises near the western edge of Ireland\u2019s central plain, known as Brega in early writings. This plain presently includes most of Co. Meath. Like other mountains of significance in the midlands, Tlachtga is not striking, but its peak presents a stunning view of almost half of Ireland. The mythic hills of Tara, Slane, and Loughcrew are visible on a clear day. A large series of earthworks forming a circular Hillfort with four big banks forming a shape similar to the Rath of the Synods on Tara, was probably capped with wooden palisades to construct a protective wall. There are several wells closeby, one of which is called Druid\u2019s Well, with an unusual name, and is believed to be the source of the water described in an ancient poem as the appropriate offering to the king at Tara. Despite the neglect by scholars and archaeologists, Tlachtga was highly significant in the past. Its peculiar name includes the word for \"earth\" in modern Irish, tlacht, from which some have proposed a lost goddess of that name; the second syllable seems to mean \"ray\" or \"spear\" (see G\u00e1e Bulga). It has been stated in some old texts that Tlachtga hill obtained its name from a Witch, who was known to be the daughter of the magician Mog Ruith. The story about this Witch is bewildering, as it tells of her journey to Italy in order to study under the guidance of Simon Magus, a renowned magician. It is said that she was taught to make a flying wheel called Roth Ramach and used this artifact to return home to Ireland. However, the Three sons of Simon Magus somehow found her and ravished her on the hill that now bears her name. It was also the place where she died while giving birth to the three sons of the three brothers, and her remains were buried there. Just like the parallel figure of Tailtiu, Tlachtga was remembered through a festival which was organized in her honor by the god Lugh."
