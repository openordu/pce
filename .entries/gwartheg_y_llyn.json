    "text": "Folkloric figures named gwartheg y llyn are prominent in Welsh stories. Like other Celtic nations, the ancient Celts valued their herds and tales of Fairy Cows are well-known. The cattle were believed to be from the Otherworld in Scotland and Ireland, and commonly had red bodies and white ears as typical coloring of fairy beings. However, in Wales, these cattle were entirely white like ghosts and were called gwartheg. They could crossbreed with earthly farmers' stock, which was beneficial to the mortal cows visited by a stray white fairy bull. At times, a fairy cow might opt to reside on this side of the veil, giving rise to prodigious amounts of milk until, as with the Glas Ghaibhleann myth of the cow of abundance, she was driven away by avarice. One farmer who tried to slaughter his fairy cow found her and her offspring called away by a Lake-maiden."
