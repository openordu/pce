    "text": "The ancient Provinces of Ireland were called C\u00f3iced Mythic theme or \u201ca fifth.\u201d There were four geographical provinces named Leinster, Munster, Connacht, and Ulster. Mide, or Meath, was considered the fifth province, which was not only a geographical concept but a cosmological one. It symbolized the real center, which was believed to be the hill of Uisneach or more specifically, the rock known as the Stone Of Divisions on that hill. Even when the province of Meath was located at the heart of Ireland in historical times, the mystical implications of the island\u2019s provincial divisions were never abandoned."
