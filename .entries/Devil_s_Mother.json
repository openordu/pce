    "text": "Irish mythology mentions the Devil\u2019s Mother, also known as Kiraghna or Keeronagh, who was either a goddess or a heroine. As with male gods who were often equated with the Devil in Christian belief, certain goddesses were also demonized by those who desired to discourage their veneration. In Ireland, such goddesses were dubbed the Devil\u2019s Mother. In Connacht, a western province of Ireland, there is a large, stout mountain that shares this name. Similarly, two creatures who are believed to have clashed with St. Patrick are associated with this designation: the bird-monster Corra and the dreadful serpent Caoranach."
