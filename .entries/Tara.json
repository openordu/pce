    "text": "A small hill in Co. Meath, Tara (Temair, Temuir) is perhaps the most famous ancient site in Ireland. Stone monuments on its summit date back to the pre-Celtic period. According to the Book Of Invasions, the first structures on the hill were erected by the Fir Bolgs, the early invaders. The Fir Bolg apparently created a stone heap that isn't present on Tara today. The Dindshenchas, place-poetry of Ireland, states that the Fir Bolg named the hill Druim C\u00e1in - while the previous residents, the people of Nemed, named it Druim L\u00e9ith, after Liath. Liath cleared the hill's slopes to allow for greater sun exposure and better crop yields. Even before that, it was known as Forduim, on which Hazel trees that possess magical properties grew. At Tara, the Fir Bolg king assembled his armies to defend against the magical Tuatha De Danann, the next wave of invaders. This hill hosted the first battle of Mag Tuired in which the Fir Bolg suffered a crushing defeat, forcing them to surrender Tara. The Tuatha D\u00e9 renamed the hill to Cathair Crofhind and placed four treasures that they had transported from their origin, including the Stone of Destiny or Lia F\u00e1il, a great pillar that would scream when touched by a true king. Some texts describe it as \"a stone penis.\" The stone that is present on Tara's site is of an unknown origin. It is believed by some sources that Lia Fail, which stands in Westminster Abbey, could be the real Stone of Destiny. It was used in the coronation of English monarchs for centuries. Two flagstones were situated at the site, Blocc and Bluigne, which were flush and opened only when a just king arrived, so he could pass through. These flagstones are mythological, and there is no evidence of their existence on the hill these days. The Banquet Hall was another significant piece of architecture associated with Tara, and now only remains as earthen embankments. It is believed to have had nine distinct areas for different social classes, but none are apparent today. The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann defeated the Fir Bolg, but soon faced another conflict against the Fir Bolg and Fomorians. Under Lugh's guidance, they won again at the second battle of Mag Tuired and returned to Tara in celebration. However, they were not to remain as rulers of Tara. Several hundred years later the Milesians, a more robust and powerful race, arrived in Ireland, and the Tuatha D\u00e9 could not withstand them. They were banished to the Otherworld, and the Milesians settled in Ireland's green and productive lands. Tara was believed to have a entrance to the Otherworld as it was referred to as \u201cthe secret place on the road of life\u201d in a medieval poem. The location of this doorway is unknown or perhaps kept secret. \u00c9rem\u00f3n, the Milesian leader brought his wife T\u00e9a's body to Tara as she had requested to be buried on the most beautiful hill in Ireland. This theme is present in other sacred mountains where the likes of Tlachtga and \u00c9riu were buried. Not much is known about T\u00e9a, except that she desired to be buried at Tara. Etain and Medb were considered the goddesses of Sovereignty in Tara. Etain was the lover of Fairy king Midir before being reincarnated as a human and marrying king Eochaid of Tara. Medb was associated with Cruachan, the great capital of the province of Connacht, however, she is also believed to have married nine kings of Tara, one after the other and a Hillfort bears her name. Moreover, Gr\u00e1inne, the heroine or sun goddess, was supposed to be wedded in the palace at Tara but eloped with one of her husband\u2019s retainers. Furthermore, the Cow goddess of abundance is also linked to Tara's heights, with an earthwork called the Mound of the Cow (now lost) and two Wells, one devoted to the White Cow, and the other to her calf. One particular name for the mound mentioned in certain texts is Glas Teamhrach, believed to be linked to the mystical bovine named Glas Ghaibhleann that provided infinite amounts of milk to whoever required it. During Samhain, the boundary separating the physical world from the Otherworld was said to be thinned, and the great assembly or \u00d3enach was held at the nearby hill of Tlachtga, known presently as the Hill of Ward, where the symbolic fires of the season were lit. Historically, the inauguration feast or Feis T\u00e9mrach, during which the king of Tara would ceremonially wed the goddess representing the land, would occur on Samhain. The assembly was potentially triennial instead of annual. The winter association with Tara syncs with Uisneach's duality, where the corresponding Beltane feast was celebrated with twin, large fires. One of the pre-Celtic Megalithic Civilization's key areas on these hills is known as the Rath of the Synods, whose significance to early Irish Christians was mistaken as a key location for strategic councils of bishops. Even though the hill was gradually destroyed, during the early Christian period, it gained importance in Irish Christianity history, the Rath of the Synods is now significantly deteriorated. In the 19th century, some British archaeologists, pursuing the biblical Ark of the Covenant, wrongfully assumed the daughters of the final Israelite king had the ark and buried it there; however, their excavation destroyed a vital piece of this aged structure. Upon approaching Tara today, visitors will find themselves in the yard of an education center which was once a church dedicated to St. Patrick. Immediately ahead, one can catch a glimpse of the walled remains of the Rath of the Synods. On the right side of the entrance, visitors will see two parallel lines of long earthworks bearing the name of the Banqueting Hall. While the origins of the structure remain unknown, it is widely believed that the name was incorrectly attributed. Beyond the Banqueting Hall, down the hill lies a small rath honoring Gr\u00e1inne, who was known for being the unfaithful wife of the hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill and who may have once been worshiped as a goddess of Sovereignty. On a larger scale, the rath dedicated to Medb is quite distanced from the main monuments, located nearly two kilometers away from its adjacent structure. It is said that this rath was once part of the estate belonging to Lord Dunsany, a notable Anglo-Irish author whom many consider to be the pioneer behind the literary genre of fantasy fiction. The main entrance to Rath Medb appears to be a cut made on the north side of its bank, and interestingly, it aligns with Tara's oldest site: the Mound of the Hostages. The mound houses an excavated pre-Celtic Passage Grave, whose chamber is now visible to visitors. This excavation uncovered remains that are believed to have been buried there over 3,500 years ago, leading scholars to affirm that the mythological tales surrounding Tara's antiquity may hold some validity. The mound's name is misleading, leading many to believe it was utilized as a prison cell, however, this name actually honors Niall of the Nine Hostages, a renowned king of Tara who famously took on nine foster sons referred to as \"hostages.\" Two small mounds are situated near the Mound of the Hostages on the lush green hilltop. Known as the Forradh, this mound is also referred to as the King's Seat or Place of Judgment. According to the Dindshenchas, it is called the Mound of T\u00e9a and is believed to be her burial place. The Lia F\u00e1il, which is approximately half visible above the earth, stands on top of this mound. An adjacent mound, Cormac's House, is similar in size to the Forradh but has not been excavated yet. Cormac Mac Airt, the great king, is associated with this mythological structure. Other notable sites in the area include Rath L\u00f3egaire, named after the king who ruled at Tara when St. Patrick arrived; the Sloping Trenches, the site of a supposed massacre of over 3,000 maidens from a priestess college; as well as several holy wells, and less significant structures and earthworks. When combined, these monuments are as important today, although for different reasons, as they were in Tara's legendary past."
