    "text": "Taranis is known to be a Continental Celtic deity who is associated with lightning and the fire that often follows. The name Taranis, also spelled as Taranos, Taranoos, or Taranucnos, is derived from a Celtic term used to describe \"thunder\". This god is depicted with a hammer, although Sucellus is also identified as this god. The Romans believed Taranis to be the chief Celtic divinity and linked him to their own chief god Jupiter. However, there is no indication that Taranis was the head of a pantheon. The Roman poet Lucan wrote that Taranis, referred to as the \"master of war\", was venerated through Human Sacrifices, specifically those requiring victims to be burnt alive."
