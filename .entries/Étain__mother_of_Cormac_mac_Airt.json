    "text": "A woman named Achtan, known otherwise as \u00c9tain, was the mother of Cormac mac Airt. Art Mac Cuinn, an Irish hero staying with a Smith on the night prior to a battle, was informed that any offspring of \u00c9tain were meant to be lords of Tara. Hoping to have such a son, Art lay with \u00c9tain that night. He then instructed that a friend in Connacht should foster any child of theirs. Art went to fight and ultimately met his end. Following the birth of her son, \u00c9tain complied with Art's wishes and journeyed to her foster father's house in Connacht to give birth, but she was caught in a severe storm that prompted her contractions. After giving birth to Cormac, \u00c9tain went to look for assistance, but upon returning, she discovered that a female wolf had taken the child. Cormac was raised to adolescence by the wolf who had adopted him. When Cormac claimed the throne of Tara, he and \u00c9tain were reunited."
