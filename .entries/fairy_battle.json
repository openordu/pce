    "text": "Folktales often depict battles between fairies. These supernatural beings were believed to be immortal and viewed battles as enjoyable games, much like the way we might view sporting events. In Ireland, fairies from different regions would engage in contests, similar to modern-day hurling matches. They would travel to battle at night and return the wounded back to their homes at dawn. These battles were so intense that it was believed that the phlegm-like substances found on bushes in the mornings were remnants of the fairies' blood, constantly spilled during their never-ending battles."
