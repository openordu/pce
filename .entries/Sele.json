    "text": "A folkloric figure known as Sele (Seelie) has been found in different variations across Britain and Scotland. While its usage appears in reference to Fairy folk, sacred hills, folkloric figures and festivals, the name has been linked to many things. The origin of the name may not be Celtic, as it appears to be tied to Old Norse and Teutonic words such as saell, \u201chappy,\u201d saeli, \u201cblessed,\u201d and to Sil and Silly, Sal and Sally, which are used to address female figures in tales and folklore. One of its variants, the Seelie Court, refers to a group of good fairies in Britain and Scotland, with its counterpart being the UNSeelie Court, which comprises of evil fairies. Connections have also been drawn between Seelie and the magical Mermaid, the Silkie, and the sun goddess Sul."
