    "text": "A hero from Brittany, Gradlon Muer, Grallon, Garallon or Gralon, is the subject of one of the most compelling stories from the Celtic area of France, namely Cornuoille or Brittany. The story revolves around the king Gradlon and his daughter Dahut, who was known for her beauty and her pagan beliefs. Despite the warnings of the monk Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 about her supposed evil tendencies, Gradlon indulged Dahut's every whim, even attending her nightly balls and other entertainments within the walls protecting the low-lying city from the sea's surges. But the city of Ys was doomed, as Dahut drew the attention of Cado, a sea god or monster, who aimed to drag the princess down to his undersea world. Despite Gradlon's conversion to Christianity, as he accepted the monk's faith, Dahut's more traditional views led to the destruction of the magnificent city of Ys. In some versions, Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 forces Gradlon to sacrifice Dahut to save himself, while in others, they both escape the deluge. Gradlon also appears in other tales from Brittany, which portray him as the ideal Celtic regional king, making his land prosperous and defending it against Viking invasions on the Loire River. In some texts, later kings of the region are said to have borne his name."
