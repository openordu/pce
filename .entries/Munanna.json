    "text": "In Irish folklore, there is an account of a woman named Munanna who is considered a heroine. Munanna became tired of her mundane life with her unexciting husband and decided to leave him for a Viking pirate whom she found to be more appealing. She convinced her new lover to murder her husband and together, they embarked on a sea voyage. Eventually, they settled in Norway, but Munanna\u2019s new husband became apprehensive that she might repeat her earlier actions. During an outing, he pushed her into the water, resulting in her tragic death. As a repercussion, Munanna began to haunt him by transforming into a Crane, which is a common animal form for women who have suffered injustices. She flew around his boat, a constant reminder of her presence and curse."
