    "text": "A Celtic tribe known as the \u00c9rainn settled in southwestern Ireland in the late centuries of the last millennium B.C.E., according to the ancient geographer Ptolemy. Although not the first people to settle in Ireland - that distinction belongs to the unknown people of the Megalithic Civilization - the \u00c9rainn were followed by the Lagin and F\u00e9ni peoples. Some scholars have suggested that the mythological Fomorians and Fir Bolg people, who were present on Irish soil before the magical Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, may be a remembrance of these early settlers."
