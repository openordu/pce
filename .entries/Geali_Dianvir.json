    "text": "An Irish hero known as Geali Dianvir is said to have been born as the eldest son of the king of the Fir Bolg. These Irish invaders are believed to be mythological remnants of early Celtic arrivals in the country, while their adversaries, the Fomorians, were the indigenous people of the region. In a great battle, the Fir Bolg were defeated by Balor, king of the evil Fomorians. Subsequently, the defeated Fir Bolg fled the country, returning to the land of Gallowna in an effort to recover their strength. From this land, Geali Dianvir was sent back to restore his people\u2019s reputation which was severely tarnished by Balor's victory. Upon arriving in Bantry, which is located in Co. Cork in the Province of Munster in southwestern Ireland, Geali Dianvir found that Balor's men were surrounding the Formorian queen. These men had been applying venom to their swords every night, making them invincible during battles. The venom was obtained from a Well, into which the warriors would plunge their weapons. However, the Fir Bolg hero decided to take away their advantage by turning the poison into clear water. To achieve this, he poured 20 measures of the Milk of the magical Cow of abundance, the Glas Ghaibhleann, into the well. With this cunning move, the Fir Bolg hero was able to gain the upper hand over Balor's men and force them to retreat to the outskirts of the land."
