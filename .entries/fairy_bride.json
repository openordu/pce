    "text": "Brides are among the top categories of humans susceptible to Fairy Kidnapping, a common theme in folklore. Countless tales revolve around brides who come back home in their bridal attire, only to be engulfed in a deep slumber from which they cannot awaken (refer to Fairy Sleep). To rescue the bride, the groom had to locate the Fairy Mound, where the bride's soul was held captive, and steal her back. However, even after the bride was retrieved, she remained unconscious. To revive her, her garments were thoroughly searched for any trace of FairyLAND, even a Pin or a thread. Once removed, her consciousness immediately returned. While some stories recount young grooms being captured by Fairy Lovers while on the way to their weddings, the risk for brides was notably higher."
