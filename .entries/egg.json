    "text": "Symbolic object, the egg, is a recurring element in the iconography of Celtic goddesses of abundance such as Sirona. As a symbol of potential life, eggs also held the possibility of rebirth, a concept reflected in their presence among grave goods. Certain eggs were even imbued with magical properties, like Cl\u00eddna's birds' crimson eggs, which granted Shape-Shifting abilities to those who consumed them. It is believed that the Serpent's Stone, a magical object shaped like an egg, may have symbolized an egg."
