    "text": "A Continental Celtic Goddess by the name of Devona (Divona) has very little known about her. It is possible that she is the same deity as Sirona, the Gaulish goddess of Healing. The belief in the healing powers of springs, particularly thermal or hot springs, was widespread. Modern science is beginning to support the idea behind this belief. Devona could have been considered a spring goddess, as the second part of her name appears to have been derived from the Celtic root for \u201cstream,\u201d with the first syllable meaning \u201cgoddess.\u201d"
