    "text": "An Irish hero known as Maelduin (Maeldun, Maeld\u00fain, Maol D\u00fain, Mael D\u00fain, Maeldune) was the focus of one of the most famous Voyage poems of ancient Ireland. There are varying reports of when the poem was recorded, with some sources indicating it was recorded in the ninth century and others stating the 11th century. Maelduin's origin involved violence as his father had raped a nun who later died giving birth to Maelduin. He was raised by his aunt who recounted to him the story of his birth. In an epic story known as the \"Irish Odyssey,\" Maelduin set off with 60 warriors to avenge his father who had been killed by Viking invaders. Together they had great adventures, encountering giant ants, monster cats, and other unusual creatures. They ultimately arrived at an Otherworld Island where they all found Fairy Lovers. These lovers were difficult to leave and nearly kept the group captive for eternity, but they eventually returned to the human world."
