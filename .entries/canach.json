    "text": "The Scottish folktale of canach (also known as catkin or cl\u00f2imh-chat) centers around a specific motif. It involves the fluffy white wool that can be found on the cattail, a type of reed that is commonly found in marshes. Long ago, people believed that Witches had the ability to shape-shift into this material and use it to ride to their secret gatherings on the winds. A similar belief was held about snowflakes, which could serve as a hiding spot for witches as they traveled. Catkins, or the wooly fibers that carry the seeds of trees like birch and poplar, could be twisted into little white cords that would supposedly keep Witchcraft and other malevolent forces at bay."
