    "text": "The pilgrimage represented the journey of life in which one travels to a sacred place, leading to the inevitability of death and the afterlife. This symbolism is present in both Christian and Islamic religions but did not have a significant role in Celtic thought. Although the Celts did travel to holy sites, the concept of travel and pilgrimage were not interchangeable. Unlike other religions, Celtic religion did not have a single, unchanging holy center where people could go at any time to find sanctity. Instead, the concept of the center was more cosmological in nature (see Mide) and sites were linked to specific hours and days. Therefore, pilgrimage in the traditional sense was not a practice among the Celts, as people would travel to many local sites for various reasons. The existence of such sites can still be observed through the patterns and rituals practiced at these places today."
