    "text": "A figure of Cornish folklore, the hooper or hooter, is a weather spirit that can be helpful, but also has a vindictive streak similar to the Scottish Gray Man. The hooper appears as a dense fog or a cloudy curtain with a central light, completely obstructing all visibility. Those who witness the hooper are warned to stay ashore, as the appearance of the hooper is always followed by violent storms. According to legend, a sailor who scoffed at the hooper and continued on with their crew disappeared into the darkness and was never seen again."
