    "text": "A deity or hero of Ireland and Scotland is Aonghus (Angus, Aengus, Oengus). Different mythological and heroic personalities of these regions share this name, which means \"strength\" or \"vigor.\" Aonghus \u00d3g, also known as Aonghus mac \u00d3g or \"Angus son of youth,\" was the god of beauty and poetry among the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann and is similar to the Welsh god Mabon. He was magically conceived, even for a god: His father, the Dagda, \u201cborrowed\u201d his mother Eithne from her husband Elcmar, then made the sun stay overhead for nine months. This allowed the goddess to gestate the child without Elcmar realizing that more than a day had passed. After his birth, Aonghus \u00d3g was promptly sent to the god Midir to be fostered. In an alternate version, the mother was B\u00f3and, the cuckolded husband was Nechtan, and the foster father was Elcmar. In any case, the son inherited from his father, gaining the great carved-stone palace known as the Br\u00fa Na B\u00f3inne by deceit. Trees in the palace held out tempting fruit, and two pigs were cooked and consumed by turns, only to revive again. Several experts associate these tales with other traditions in which a son overcomes or replaces his father, as in the Greek myth of Saturn and Uranus or Zeus and Saturn. He is referred to as \"Aonghus of the many exploits\" and \"mighty Mac in Oc\" in the place-poems called the Dindshenchas. When Aonghus \u00d3g traveled, four white swans flew about his head. When he fell in love, it was with a woman he had only seen in a dream, as recounted in the Aislinge \u00d3enguso, the Dream of Aonghus. For a year, Aonghus's lover appeared to him in his dreams, causing him to yearn to be with her physically. Magician Bodb Derg assisted Aonghus in discovering his beloved C\u00e1er, and they both transformed into white swans with an enchanting song that captivated others to slumber for three days and nights. This myth subsequently inspired the composition of William Butler Yeats's poem, \"The Song of Wandering Aengus,\" while a different but sensual version of the character made an appearance in James Stephens's comic novel, The Crock of Gold. Aonghus was a fairy who enticed hero C\u00fachulainn to the Otherworld to meet his lustful sisters and was also the brother of Fand and L\u00ed Ban. Furthermore, he was the inspiration for the name of the Aran Islands' D\u00fan Aonghusa, a grand stone fortress, as Aonghus of the Fir Bolg."
