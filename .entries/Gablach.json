    "text": "A tale of a brave Irish woman named Gablach, who was known for her heroic deeds, especially for defending her beloved. Her fianc\u00e9 was a giant named Lutur from Spain, who was equally huge. When Gablach\u2019s family met Lutur, they were surrounded by an army who demanded a battle, as the human hero Fuither desired to win Gablach\u2019s heart. However, Lutur picked up a roofbeam and killed several dozen soldiers, which excited Gablach, leading her to join in the fight. In her energetic defense of her betrothed, Gablach killed Fuither, thus putting an end to his violent attempt to win her hand."
