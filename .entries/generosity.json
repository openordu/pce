    "text": "In Celtic culture, generosity was a paramount requirement for a king. The breach of this sacred value, as seen in the case of the halfFOMORIAN Bres, resulted in his dethronement and potential miserable death as a punishment for his stinginess. The significance of this Cosmological concept was converted into the general expectation of hospitality towards strangers in Celtic regions. Even in the post-Celtic era, the belief that Fairies would penalize those who were not generous kept the value alive. It was considered the most important aspect among the various requirements or sacred vows (see Geis) a king had to fulfill."
