    "text": "Ogmios, a god of the Continental Celts, was linked by the Greek satirist Lucian of Samosata in the second century C.E. to the mighty classical hero Hercules. However, it appears that the strength of Ogmios lay more in speech than in physical prowess. This Celtic god was often depicted as a bald man with dark skin, dragging people around by chains that stretched from his tongue to their ears, symbolizing the power of eloquence over its listeners. His metaphorical strength earned him the name Trenfher, meaning \u201cstrong man.\u201d Ogmios\u2019s advanced age suggests that refined speech is a gift of maturity rather than youth. On certain occasions, Ogmios was connected to the Otherworldly divinity Dis Pater, as he was said to guide the dead to the Otherworld."
