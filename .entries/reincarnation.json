    "text": "The concept of reincarnation or rebirth is a cosmological idea that has been disputed with regards to whether the Celts believed in it. The term reincarnation is often used when describing the eastern philosophical and religious belief that a person is repeatedly born into human form, with the actions of one life impacting those of the next life, which is known as the Hindu concept of karma. When a soul is believed to reside in different forms, including animals and humans, instead of using the term reincarnation, the appropriate term would be Transmigration of Souls. Julius Caesar stated that the Druids believed a new life was granted to individuals after death. This understanding explained the impressive bravery of Celtic warriors in battle because they knew they would receive a new body after the one they currently occupied was killed. However, since Caesar sought to conquer the Celtic culture, he may not be a completely credible source. Similarly, Diodorus of Sicily argued that the Celts believed in reincarnation, yet he attempted to demonstrate that the Celtic belief system was similar to that of the Hellenic philosopher Pythagoras who believed in being reborn in multiple forms, not always as a human. Several Celtic myths have had legendary beings that were reborn in various forms, such as \u00c9tain, Tuan Mac Cairill, Fintan, Friuch, and Taliesin, but it is still not clear whether this belief applied to the ordinary individual. The topic of what the Celts believed about the afterlife remains debatable. The possibility exists that gods, goddesses, heroines, and heroes were sometimes reborn as a means of emphasizing their divine and unique qualities, given that Celtic deities were not always immortal. An Otherworld exists where newly deceased individuals, previous deceased individuals' spirits, magical creatures, and divinities coexist. This concept, while similar to heaven in Christianity, does not necessarily indicate reincarnation as a belief held by Celts. The possibility of reincarnation in Celtic belief remains an unanswered question."
