    "text": "Irish hero Gavida, also known as Gaibl\u00edn, Gaibhleen or Goibhleann, was the brother of Cian and the uncle of hero Lugh. Gavida played a vital role as he fostered his nephew, Lugh, until he became capable enough to fulfill his destiny - killing his monstrous grandfather Balor of the Evil Eye. At times, Gavida is also regarded as the Smith god known as Goibniu."
