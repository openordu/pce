    "text": "Robin Hood is a legendary figure in British folklore who is known for robbing from the rich to give to the poor. While there may be some historical basis to the Robin Hood story, it largely exists in myth. Robin is said to have lived in medieval times with his band of robbers in Sherwood Forest, along with his beloved Maid Marian, Little John, and Friar Tuck. The Robin Hood legend is generally more literate than oral, and has been enjoyed more by upper classes than lower ones, despite his alleged bias toward the latter. Robin Hood was originally called Robin Locksley and was born in Brandfield Parish in Hallamshire. After accidentally injuring his stepfather and fearing retribution, Robin fled to Loxley forest where he met Little John, a Giant hermit who may have actually existed. Some scholars have attempted to find a mythological basis for the Robin Hood stories, with many connecting him to the Green Man, a spirit of vegetation and fertility. Under this interpretation, Robin Hood was once known as Robin of the Wood or Jack-In-The-Green, who was said to have ruled as the king of the May while Maid Marian was his queen. Figures associated with the Beltane festival were often linked to the Midsummer festivities of late June. In Loxley forest there is a spot known as Robin Hood's Bower which, according to local church records, was utilized for Beltane celebrations involving a green-clad man. A similar custom can still be observed in Castleon, while at Abbots Bromley, men perform a horn dance around a cross-dressed Maid Marion. Certain mythical tales suggest that the misdeeds of a historical highwayman became fused with an earlier mythological figure responsible for shaping the landscape. One such legend recounts how Robin Hood and Little John once challenged each other to a leaping contest. Robin claimed that he could jump over Wormsley Hill, but instead caused part of the hill to break off with his heel, forming Butthouse Knapp. When Little John attempted the jump, he too struck the hill with his heel, resulting in the formation of Pyon Hill. Even now, these hills are collectively referred to as Robin Hood's Butts. Folklore claims that Robin still safeguards the area, as treasure hunters who attempted to dig there found their tools disturbed and Gorse growing over what they had dug the previous day. Such trickery is typically attributed to fairies, linking this legend of Robin and Little John to the Otherworld domain."
