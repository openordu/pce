    "text": "A creature from Irish mythology, Sceolan (also known as Sceolang), is the subject of a tale where shapeshifting is a significant motif. According to the story, Sceolan was originally a human, but his mother Uirne was turned into a dog by a bewitchment. Although she returned to being human later on, her two twin pups, Sceolan and Bran, did not transform back. Fionn Mac Cumhaill, a hero and Sceolan's uncle, took in both dogs to his group of warriors known as the Fianna, where they excelled as hunters, fighters, and guardians."
