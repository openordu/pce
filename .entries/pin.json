    "text": "Symbolic objects known as pins were often offered at Celtic holy sites, particularly those related to water such as wells and river sources. These pins, which were often made of small bits of metal or bone, have been associated with the act of sewing cloth together and may have acted as symbolic prayers for healing and repairing broken bones or hearts. Within Fairy lore, minute pins were said to be hidden within the clothing of individuals who fell victim to Fairy Kidnapping. Upon returning to the mortal world from the Otherworld, these individuals would remain comatose until the remnants of fairyland were located and removed."
