    "text": "In a curious tale of faithfulness and betrayal, Rhun, a Welsh hero, becomes embroiled in a challenge against King Elphin's bragging. Elphin boasted that his wife was more faithful than Rhun\u2019s. To disprove Elphin's claim, Rhun journeyed to Elphin's court, where he attempted to seduce the queen. The queen refused, and so Rhun resorted to drugging her and cutting off her ring finger. He then brought it to Elphin, not realizing that the queen and handmaiden had switched roles. The bread dough beneath the fingernail was evidence enough that the queen had not endured the disfigurement. Despite this, Rhun continued his contest with Elphin, now betting on whose horses were swifter. However, with the help of the clever bard, Taliesin, Elphin employed a clever trick to clinch victory and send Rhun packing."
