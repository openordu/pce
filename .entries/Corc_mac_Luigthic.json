    "text": "Conall Corc, also known as Corc mac Luigthic or Conall mac Luigthig, was an exemplary Irish hero who was crowned as the king of Cashel, situated in the southwest province of Munster. Interestingly, his Fairy mother Fedelm performed his inauguration ceremony, during which his ear was miraculously scorched into a reddish hue. Though he journeyed to Scotland to meet the Pictish ruler, he was betrayed with an attempt on his life, for his shield carried Ogham inscriptions requesting his assassination. Thanks to one of his supporters, the message was modified to extend a warm welcome instead. Consequently, Corc married the king's daughter, and subsequently returned to Ireland and founded his dynasty."
