    "text": "A Welsh princess named Herzeloyde was a character in Arthurian literature. She was a heroine who refused to marry just anyone; she wanted a man who was genuinely valorous. As a result, she announced that whoever won a tournament would gain her hand in marriage. After many years voyaging in the east, the soldier Gahmuret arrived on the scene in time to claim the prize. Gahmuret was rather restless and, after impregnating his bride, departed once again for the east, where he met his downfall and was killed. Heartbroken, Herzeloyde moved to a tiny forest cottage where she gave birth to her son, Percival, whom she intended to raise without any knowledge of his lineage. However, when Percival was of age, his heroic blood eventually led him to become a member of King Arthur's court at Camelot."
