    "text": "Welsh mythology recounts the existence of Caer Arianrhod (Caer Aranrhod), believed to be a great mythic castle belonging to Arianrhod, a goddess or heroine of the Mabinogion. As per local lore, the castle and the Breton city of Ys were destroyed by an inundation brought on by the transgressions of the residents; scholars suggest that this is a belief from post-pagan times that reflects Christian views on the wanton and uninhibited behavior of the goddess. Arianrhod is said to have had relations with Mermen. Today, the ruins of the castle are believed to be the rock formation off the coast of North Wales, about a mile into the sea; however, other claims contend that it was elevated to the heavens."
