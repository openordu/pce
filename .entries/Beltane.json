    "text": "Celtic festival known as Beltane (Bealtaine, Beltain, Beltine, Beltaine, Bealtane, L\u00e0 Beltain, May Eve, May Day, C\u00e9tshamain) was traditionally celebrated on May 1. It was considered one of the four important festivals of the ancient Celtic year, with roots in the cycle of grazing and planting. Although the calendar was not found on the Continent, it represents only the Irish seasonal cycle. Beltane was primarily observed as an agricultural festival signifying the beginning of summer and the movement of cattle from winter pastures to mountain buaile or \u201cbooleys\u201d of summer, where the grass would be fresh and green. Weather divination played an important role for the Beltane festival, with frost being deemed ominous of bad times ahead and rain symbolizing good fortune and a strong harvest. The Beltane festival began at sundown on the eve of the festival day, much like Samhain, a day when the boundaries between the Otherworld, the world of Fairies and the dead, and our world, opened up enough for communication. However, while Samhain was essentially a festival of the dead, Beltane was said to be a festival for the living. Vibrant spirits were said to come forth seeking incarnation in human bodies or intercourse with the human realm. The name Beltane has been tied to words referring to fire, and many divinities, such as Belenus and Belisama, have been linked to the bonfires of spring, which were the most prominent aspect of the Beltane celebrations in several Celtic lands. Hearth fires were put out on Beltane Eve, only to be relit using a bonfire located on the nearest signal hill. It was believed that these fires were ignited throughout Ireland in response to the sacred fire of \u00c9riu on the hill of Uisneach, positioned at the center of the island, or at its royal center, the Hill of Tara. The tale of St. Patrick lighting the \"Easter fire\" or \"Paschal fire\" while endeavoring to Christianize Ireland is not historically accurate. In fact, there would have been no Easter fires in the pre-Christian era. These flames were actually for Beltane, and Patrick was behaving both sacrilegiously and politically by lighting his own fire on Slane hill before the royal fire was lit. Beltane fires, motivated by a desire to eliminate brush before fields and pastures were utilized, continued to be lit in Wales until 1840, and in Ireland well into the middle of the 20th century. Prior to the coming year, cattle were driven near or between the fires to ensure their protection, and the sight of a white heifer among the herds (presumably an incarnation of B\u00f3and, the white cow goddess of abundance) was deemed especially significant. However, Beltane was also a time when malevolent forces could harm cattle, make their milk dry up or induce sickness and death, essentially threatening agricultural produce this time of year. Consequently, many Beltane rituals, such as hunting hares (presumed to be shape-shifted witches) and reciting chants over butter churns, emerged from the belief that such items were particularly vulnerable to harm during this period. Indications are strong that Beltane originated as a festival to safeguard cattle. In Ulster, as well as other areas of Ireland, cattle were led around raths and other fairy-inhabited places. The animals were bled and their owners tasted the blood. The remnants were poured into the soil while hoping for the herds' safety. Similarly, in Devon, a ram was slaughtered while tied to a Standing Stone. Its blood flowed over the rock and its charred flesh was eaten, hide and all, for good luck. Beltane was dedicated not only to animal welfare but also to human wellness. Besides Imbolc on February 1 and Lughnasa on August 1, Beltane was one of the most regularly visited Irish holy wells. Visitors to the wells were engaged in Patterns or ritual walks, usually in a sunwise direction. They left offerings such as coins or Clooties, bits of cloth tied to the sacred trees that grew near the well, and prayed for healing and health. Wordless and without looking back, they left the site after the rituals. In many places in Ireland, the rituals still continue, which may once have included carrying sacred water to Beltane ritual sites, where trees and fields were sprinkled with prayers for a bountiful harvest. Until the late 19th century, decorating the May bush was popular in rural Ireland and urban areas, with groups attempting to create the most dazzling tree covered with flowers, ribbons, and scraps of bright fabric. The dwelling place of fairy folk was traditionally the Thorn tree, which was commonly used as the May bush, although other trees like the Ash were also substituted. However, in Ireland, the Ash was frequently regarded as the primary Beltane tree. Outside of towns in Dublin and Belfast, bushes were cut and subsequently decorated in various neighborhoods. Attempts to steal another district's May bush often resulted in much merriment. Nonetheless, depraved acts by certain Beltane revelers caused the May bush to become forbidden during Victorian times. In Cornwall, the Sycamore served as the preferred \"May tree.\" The branches of this tree were stripped of their new leaves by celebrants who then crafted little flutes out of them. The festival persisted in a rudimentary form in Liverpool, where houses and horses were decked with flowers for the day. Superstition held that Beltane dew possessed the ability to enhance a person's sexual attraction. Maidens would roll in the grass, dip their fingers in the dew and apply it to their faces, hoping to become more beautiful as a result. The May Queen was chosen as one of the participants in the festivities in Britain. The May King would wed her ceremoniously, symbolizing the joining of the land's fertile powers. In some cases, there was only a queen without a consort, which some scholars interpret as evidence that the goddess was petitioned rather than the god at this time. Britain referred to the May King as the \"Beltane carline\" or \"old woman,\" which suggests the same conclusion. Sexual license was considered an essential part of the annual event, as it was intended to boost the land's yield. English Beltane festivals centered around the Maypole, which is an unmistakably phallic symbol, and around which dancers cavorted (see Morris Dancing). A cut tree was brought in from the woodland and set up in the town square or a similar public gathering place\u2014this was the full ritual. In the Cotswolds, the maypole was connected to \u201csummer bowers\u201d made out of new budding trees that were adorned with flowers and a large china doll named the \u201clady.\" Plays about Robin Hood and maze games, both of which were traditionally carried out during the Beltane festivals, gradually became children's games instead of being sacred calendrical rituals. Some English towns still have remnants of the maypole festival, most notably Chipping Campden. Nowadays, maypole dancing is primarily a folkloric revival since the dances were banned in Puritan England in 1644. The concern of Puritans wasn't so much the dances themselves but their usual aftermath, which were the \u201cgreenwood weddings\u201d of young people who'd spend Beltane night together under the pretext of gathering flowers to deck the town next morning. The Puritans complained about girls who went a-maying \u201cdid not one of them return a virgin.\u201d Animal sacrifices, although less common, continued to the end of historical times\u2014for example, in Dublin, the skull and bones of a horse were burned. Some individuals have also claimed that human sacrifice could have taken place during this period, but it is possible that it only occurred during times of plague and need. One component of the Beltane festival in Britain, until the 18th century, was baking a round cake that was shattered and shared out; the \"devoted\" person was the one who got the blackened piece. The other celebrants then pantomimed pushing the chosen one into the fire, suggesting an ancient sacrificial ritual. Beltane bannocks, circular pastries made from the final sheaves of the prior year's yield, were typically utilized in Britain as offerings to the land. The person making the offering would recite, \u201cI give you this, preserve my horses; I give you this, preserve my sheep; I give the Foxes this, preserve my lambs; I give this to the hoodie Crow and to the Eagle.\u201d In the Isle of Man, where witches were rumored to be active during the festival, they would light Beltane fires and distribute flowers to dispel them. It was customary for the Manx islanders to practice divination on Beltane, or the night before it. If a house was lit with bright light, it indicated an impending wedding, whereas dim light indicated a funeral. Girls placed snails on pewter dishes on this night and observed them until midnight, washing their faces and hands in dew from a wheat field, in hopes that the creatures would spell their future husbands' names on the platters. The Beltane ceremony also included the protection of cattle and residences, with rushes and primroses scattered in the doorway and Rowan crosses tied around the cattle's necks. To protect against fairy powers, elder tree leaves were affixed to doors and windows. Dewdrops collect from fairy beauty, used by humans as a Beltane-enhancing potion; however, it was discontinued around fifty years ago. On the Isle of Man, until quite recently, Beltane festivities included a staged reenactment of a competition between the Queen of Winter and the Queen of May, symbolized by young ladies who were accompanied by their followers in simulated combat that culminated in a celebration. Garlands made of rowan and honeysuckle were used in Scotland to protect cattle from witchcraft. Additionally, dairy cattle were safeguarded from milk-stealing witches by threading red threads in their hair or weaving them into the garlands. Beltane, when witches were most active, saw a pot of eggs, butter, oatmeal, and milk being placed on the fire after which the resulting oatcake was divided into nine parts and offered to the crows, eagles, foxes and other animals who stand to steal the harvest, so they could be appeased. The Beltane festival, which involved driving cattle between Beltane fires for purification, continued till the 19th century in rural districts of Scotland. Recent popular works such as The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, the 1973 film The Wicker Man, and the musical Camelot reference Beltane. Glen Lyon is also worth mentioning."
