    "text": "The midwife, an important ancestral figure, was associated with the beginning of life, but was also tied to death. In Celtic tradition, she was often a woman with knowledge of medicinal properties and could prophesize the destiny of the newborn. Many cultures have given midwives the power of foresight because of their capacity to predict patterns in the birth that would continuously shape the life of the baby. They were also believed to possess a unique vision to spot when Fairies were taking human children. While traveling to attend a late-night labor, midwives might encounter fairies eager to abduct newborns; upon arrival at the dwelling, they would find the child stolen by those they met. Folklore has it that midwives ventured into the Otherworld to retrieve those children. The fairies typically targeted midwives, along with poets, musicians, lovers, and infants because they held specialized knowledge that was valuable to the Otherworld. Fairy babies were often born fragile and in need of meticulous care to survive. Unlike other fairy hostages, midwives generally returned home from the Otherworld unscathed and continued to live a healthy life."
