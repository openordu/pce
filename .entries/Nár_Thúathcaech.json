    "text": "N\u00e1r Th\u00faathcaech is an Irish hero known by the name \"Shame,\" which is also the alternate name for Friuch - an argumentative swineherd who was later reincarnated as the great Bull Donn Cuailnge. The said bull caught the attention of the renowned queen, Medb of the western province of Connacht. It is believed that N\u00e1r Th\u00faathcaech's name may have originated from the role he played in initiating the great carnage, as told in the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge. It was his provocation of Medb to marry Ailill mac M\u00e1ta that ultimately led to the famous Cattle Raid on Ulster."
