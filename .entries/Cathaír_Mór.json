    "text": "In Irish mythology, Catha\u00edr M\u00f3r (also spelled Cathaoir M\u00f3r) was a former king of Ireland before the reign of Conn of the Hundred Battles. His name means \u201cgreat battle-lord\u201d, but there is little information recorded about him aside from his replacement and demise at the hands of Conn. Catha\u00edr M\u00f3r\u2019s legacy is mostly in his fatherhood; he fathered several significant women. Among them was Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota, wife of the hero and king Cormac Mac Airt and mother of his son Cairbre Lifechair. Additionally, he fathered Cochrann, mother of the romantic hero Diarmait Ua Duibne. One text tells of a dream that Catha\u00edr had in which he witnessed a woman who was pregnant for an unusually long time finally giving birth to a son. This event occurred near a fragrant, singing fruit tree. Catha\u00edr\u2019s Druid explained that the woman was the River Slaney that ran near Tara, her child the harbor at its mouth, and the singing tree the king himself."
