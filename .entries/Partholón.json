    "text": "Irish hero known as Parthol\u00f3n, or alternatively Partholon, Parthal\u00e1n, or Parthan\u00e1n, played a minor role in the mythological history of Ireland as recorded in the Book Of Invasions. Ranked behind Cesair and ahead of Nemed and his followers, Parthol\u00f3n was believed to have been a fabrication of medieval chroniclers who fashioned his name on Bartholomaeus, a figure from early Christian pseudo-history. According to legend, Parthol\u00f3n hailed from Greece where he murdered his parents and was subsequently punished by losing his left eye. Intriguingly, the notion of the one-eyed leader, which also finds mention in the tales of Balor of the Evil Eye and the warrior Goll Mac Morna, may have originated from Celtic mythology. Approximately three decades after the deluge, Parthol\u00f3n led his tribe, the people of Parthol\u00f3n, to Ireland."
