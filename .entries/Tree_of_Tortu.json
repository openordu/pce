    "text": "The Ash of Tortu, also known as the Tree of Tortu or the Tree of Dath-\u00ed, was a revered object in Irish mythology and considered one of the five great Trees of Ireland. The Ash tree held immense significance to the Celts, who considered it a sacred entity. The Tree of Tortu was so massive that when it was felled, it spanned the entire region of Ireland. In Scottish folklore, the tree soul was considered a powerful symbol, akin to the External Soul. The Celts believed in the sanctity of Trees, and it was widely accepted that just as a human soul could inhabit an animal or a rock, it could also take shelter within a tree."
