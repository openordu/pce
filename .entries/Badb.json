    "text": "A goddess of Irish origin, Badb (also known as Bave, Badhbh, and Baobh, among others) was one of the ancient furies of war in early Irish history. Along with Macha and the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan, she was a member of a triad known as \"the three M\u00f3rr\u00edgna.\" She was also known to join forces with other formidable war goddesses, such as Nemain (meaning \"the venomous\") and Fea (often referred to as \"the hateful\") under the collective name of \"Badb and her sisters.\" Despite Badb's clear association with war, it can be difficult to pin down her unique identity from those of other furies. Badb's name, which means \"hoodie Crow\" or \"scald crow,\" refers to her appearance as a carrion bird that would fly over battlefields, screeching loudly to frighten warriors and incite their rage on the battlefield. In some myths, she is also connected with the mournful Banshee, who would cry over battlefields and foresee impending death. Her prophetic abilities were often grim in nature, typically heralding a dark and ominous future. This is exemplified by her appearance after the final mythical battle for control of Ireland, in which she described all the ills that would befall the land. Given Badb's centricity to death and destruction, it is not surprising that her name was associated with the foreboding cries of the crow. In Gaul, a similar war goddess named Cathubodua was worshipped, who could also take the form of a raven riding a horse. Tribes such as the Boduogenos (meaning \"people of Bodua\") revered her, and inscriptions in her honor were discovered in the Haute-Savoie region. Imitation in battle by black-robed women 6B 31 Druids who stood by the sidelines and screamed to incite the warriors to greater deeds, as was witnessed in the massacre and destruction of the druidic college at Anglesey, may have been done by Badb. Scholars have debated whether Badb and the other war goddesses were initially Celtic or pre-Celtic. Her connection to the unnamed Neolithic or New Stone Age goddess who was often depicted in bird form has led some scholars to argue."
