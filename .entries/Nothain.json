    "text": "A Warrior Woman of Irish legend named Nothain, shares similarities with other mad Irish figures such as Mis and Suibhne as she was also driven insane by the violence of war. In the Dindshenchas poetry of Ireland, Nothain's story is retold as a tale of tragedy where she became shaggy and wild after losing her family in a violent attack. Her father was the only member to survive the attack and he searched for over a year until he found his daughter who was unable to speak due to her overwhelming grief. After spending a night with her father, Nothain finally broke her silence, but only to inquire about the fate of her family. Upon hearing the devastating news that she was the sole survivor, Nothain died from sorrow. For further understanding on this topic, one may also refer to the concept of Madness."
