    "text": "Moriath Morca, the Irish heroine, was the daughter of the king of Munster in the far southwestern corner of the island, and her name meant \"Sealand\". Her story began with the death of Aillil \u00c1ine, the true king, at the hands of Cobthach, the high king. After Cobthach killed his own brother Labhraigh Lorc, Aillil\u2019s son, Labhraigh Moen was banished from the kingdom. However, he allied himself with Scoriath, Moriath's father, who was an enemy of Cobthach. As soon as Labhraigh saw Moriath, he fell in love with her. Moriath's father kept her closely guarded, so Labhraigh sought the help of his illustrious harper, Craiphtine. Craiphtine played so sweetly that the court fell into a blissful sleep, allowing the lovers to pledge their troth to each other. When Labhraigh had to fight Cobthach, his harper again came to the rescue by playing lulling melodies so that the enemy army fell asleep while Labhraigh's army, equipped with earplugs, stayed wide awake. After ascending to the throne of his region, Labhraigh trapped Cobthach in an Iron house and burned him to death. Some versions of the story have Moriath herself as the wooer and her own harper as the miraculous musician bearing love poems and messages to Labhraigh who became king with her help."
