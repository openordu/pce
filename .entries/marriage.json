    "text": "Marriage in Celtic culture was viewed both as a ritual and a cosmological concept. The modern definition of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman pledging sexual fidelity and economic interdependence for life is relatively recent and is limited to certain areas of the world. Due to the many different customs among the people of the Celtic world, no single tradition can be identified as a definitive rite of marriage. Many contemporary interpretations of Celtic traditions argue that they afforded greater rights to women within the marriage. However, the existence of such freedoms is contested, with some contending that they derive from earlier settlers like the Picts. Mythologically, marriage served to symbolize the connection between a king and his land. In a symbolic union with the goddess of the land\u2019s Sovereignty, the king committed himself to proper conduct, refraining from violating any of his sacred vows (Buada) or taboos (see Geis). By doing so, the land was thought to become fruitful, and the people therein would be well fed and content."
