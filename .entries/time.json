    "text": "The concept of time is not uniform across cultures, as each culture's distinctive calendar is reflective of its philosophy and values. For the Celts, days would begin at sundown and the year would mark its beginning at the feast of Samhain in November. The year was split not into four seasons but into the two seasons of summer and winter, each divided into a beginning and an end. Some ancient sources suggest that each month was divided into two parts. The year contained 12 lunar months ranging between 29 and 30 days, with an additional 13th month added every 2.5 years to reconcile this 354-day calendar with that of the sun. After two cycles of this five-year unit, a 13th month was celebrated with sacrifice and festivities. The Celts placed importance on history as it was connected to time, while also acknowledging the Otherworld where time and space were radically different, and the gods and Fairies lived."
