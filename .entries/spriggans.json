    "text": "Spriggans are supernatural beings of Cornish folklore. These creatures were originally ghosts of the ancient Giants, but later became Fairies who acted as protectors of other fairies. They had a playful nature and were typically not harmful, instead choosing to frighten off those who might disturb fairy gatherings rather than causing harm. They also had a habit of stealing valuable items, such as butter, as was common with many other fairy creatures."
