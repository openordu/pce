    "text": "An Irish hero named Ladra (Adra) appears in the Book Of Invasions, which describes the earliest arrivals in Ireland. One of the first was Cesair and her 50 handmaidens accompanied by only three men, including the ship's pilot and Cesair's brother, Ladra. After safely landing in Ireland, Ladra demanded more territory than Cesair was willing to give, leading him to depart to establish his own kingdom. He tragically died while trying to satisfy the numerous women who had accompanied him on this journey, or possibly from an oar that had penetrated his buttocks. It remains unclear from various texts whether Ladra is the same figure as Adra, or if they are separate characters."
