    "text": "In Brittany, there exists a folkloric figure known as the groa'ch, who is believed to have a connection with the Scottish and Irish Gruagach. However, unlike the helpful gruagach, the groa'ch is regarded as malevolent. Legend has it that a boy and a girl who were promised to each other from birth became orphans and had to fend for themselves as they grew up. Upon coming of age, the boy, Huarn, went on a quest to seek his fortune, and his intended, Bellah, gave him three talismans - a bell that would ring in times of danger, a knife that would cut him loose from any bonds, and a staff that would take him wherever he desired to go. Huarn journeyed until he reached the Isle of Lok, where he encountered a Fairy woman who lived in the waters of the lake. She took him under the water to show him a palace made entirely of seashells, with decorations of crystal and coral that produced sweet music with every step he took. The palace was surrounded by a garden full of aquatic plants where people were reveling up a storm. Inside the palace, Huarn encountered the groa'ch reclining on a golden bed, with her luscious green dress clinging to her curves and coral jewelry shimmering from her silky black hair. She urged him to stay with her, promising him wealth beyond measure from the sea, for her lake was connected to it through a secret passage, and all the treasure in her possession was gathered from sunken ships. Huarn was almost spellbound by the Fairy's beauty and magnificence, but back home, Bellah heard the ringing of the bell and disguised herself as a boy to come to Huarn's rescue. Escaping in unison, the palace of the water-Witch, who was both alluring and ruinous, was submerged by the vast expanse of the sea."
