    "text": "Descended from Parthol\u00f3n, the Irish conqueror, Ruturugus was regarded as a hero. Giraldus Cambrensis reported that his legacy was evident in \"things still living,\" whether that meant that his hereditary traits were still expressed or he was revived in other ways remains uncertain."
