    "text": "Celtic archaeological sites known as hillforts (also called raths, r\u00e1ths, duns, d\u00fans, lisses, and cashels) can be found throughout Ireland and, to some extent, Britain. These structures were constructed as high earth walls, usually circular, built primarily on hills. Archaeological findings suggest that wooden buildings may have been erected on these walls. The hillforts were built from roughly 700 BCE through the early Middle Ages, and were connected to Celtic settlements, trade, government, and ceremony. There is evidence to suggest that Ireland was quite densely populated during the first century of the Common Era, as more than 30,000 hillforts remain standing, each of which would have been home to several dozen to several score residents. Many towns in modern Ireland still have names that reference the hillforts of the region, such as Rathangan, Lisdoonvarna, Lisadell, and Dunmore. Cashels, which are somewhat larger than other hillforts, such as the one located in Tipperary, were built on higher and more easily defensible ground. In all cases, the earthen walls were constructed to provide defense for the site. Some hillforts, such as Grian\u00e1n Aileach, Emain Macha, Tara, and Cruachan, play important roles in myth."
