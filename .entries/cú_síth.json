    "text": "A being from Scottish folklore, known as c\u00fa s\u00edth, is described as a Highland fairy Dog that stands out from other fairy creatures due to its dark green color and size, which is similar to that of a small bull. Additionally, the c\u00fa s\u00edth leaves large footprints, as big as those of a grown man, and moves only in a straight line as it travels the world in search of prey, even attacking other dogs. Notably, unlike the Black Dog or Red with white ears, the c\u00fa s\u00edth's appearance is distinct in color and size."
