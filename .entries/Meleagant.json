    "text": "A hero in Arthurian legend is Meleagant, also known as Melwas, Meleagraunce, and Mellyagraunce. This king or giant abducted queen Guinevere and held her captive until Lancelot arrived to rescue her. However, in some retellings, Saint Gildas convinced Meleagant to release her. Lancelot had to cross a peculiar bridge to reach Guinevere, which either went underwater for a long distance or was on a narrow knife-edge above the water. Eager to be with his love, Lancelot took the upper route and hurt himself severely in the process. Once in Guinevere's chamber, he joined her in bed, but the sheets were stained with his blood. Lancelot did not realize that his friend Kay, who was also badly injured, was asleep in the same room. Even though Lancelot had left before dawn, Meleagant discovered the blood and accused Kay of sexually assaulting the queen. Too weak to defend himself, Kay was defended by Lancelot, who then freed Guinevere. Meleagant is known as the king of Somerset, the Summer Land, suggesting that he may have been either a god or a Fairy king originally."
