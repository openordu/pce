    "text": "Connla, the son of C\u00fachulainn (also known as Conla, Conla\u00ed, and Conle), is a tragic figure in Irish myth. A\u00edfe, the Warrior Woman, became pregnant with Connla after a liaison with the hero-in-training C\u00fachulainn, who was studying with A\u00edfe\u2019s mother Sc\u00e1thach. C\u00fachulainn left a ring with A\u00edfe as a token of their child\u2019s parentage in case A\u00edfe conceived. After Connla grew up, he wished to find his father. A\u00edfe gave him the ring and sent him to Ireland, where C\u00fachulainn challenged him to reveal his identity and right to enter the court of Ulster. Connla refused to disclose his name, and a fight broke out between father and son, culminating in Connla\u2019s death at the hand of his own father."
