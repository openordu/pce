    "text": "An individual of Irish mythology, Tuireann (sometimes written as Turrean) is a hero somewhat overshadowed by a similar character, Uisneach. Nevertheless, Tuireann\u2019s story of his three sons\u2019 deaths is one of the Three Sorrows Of Ireland. Cian, a hero with whom Tuireann was at war, was pursued by the young warriors. Upon realizing he was completely surrounded, Cian transformed into a Boar and fought back, but the Shapeshifting warriors transformed into Dogs and ultimately defeated him. The Sons Of Tuireann allowed Cian to transform back into his human shape just before his death. As a punishment for the murder of Cian, the Sons Of Tuireann were required to complete a series of grueling tasks that ultimately led to their death. Tuireann, who was the partner of the great goddess Danu (sometimes referred to as Donand in the narrative), died from grief upon hearing of his sons\u2019 demise."
