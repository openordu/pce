    "text": "Celtic sanctuaries were integral to their religious practices and could take various forms, such as the Nemeton - a tree grove - and sacred water sources such as a spring, well or pond. These sites were known to exist as far back as the La T\u00c8NE period, where various weapons and other objects were sacrificed and left at these shrines. While worshipping in the open air was typical, archaeologists have identified three types of sacred buildings - the Belgic type, Viereckschanzen and Celto-Ligurian. The Belgic temple was a ritual structure for sacrifice and was often rich in valuable objects such as jewelry and weapons. The Viereckschanzen was a rectangular building similar to the Belgic temple without the sacrificial goods. Lastly, the Celto-Ligurian site - a rare type of sanctuary - resembled a classical temple and was influenced by Roman architecture."
