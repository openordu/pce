    "text": "A figure of significance in Irish mythology is Lasair who is connected to a sacred well called Tobar Lasair (Tobar Lastra) located in Co. Monaghan, in the province of Ulster, and celebrated with a festival each April 18th. Lasair has a more prominent presence in Munster where she is associated with a well that she shared with her sister, Ciar, whose name means \u201cextreme darkness\u201d. Lasair's name means \u201cflame\u201d, and the two sisters might represent a cosmological concept of balance or complementarity as they are twins. Lasair features in numerous groups of heroines or goddesses alongside Latiaran and Inghean Bhuidhe, who are said to be her sisters, and with whom she lived in a monastic cell in the little town of Cullen, located in Co. Cork. Later on, Lasair moved to Killasseraugh (Cill Lasaire, translated as \u201cchurch of Lasair\u201d) where she became the patron saint of the parish. Although it is said that she had a holy well near Cullen, its location and the date of her festival have since been lost."
