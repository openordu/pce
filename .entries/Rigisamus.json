    "text": "A Celtic deity known as Rigisamus (Rigonemetis) was worshipped on both British and French soils, and his name was derived from \u201cmost kingly\u201d or \u201cmost regal.\u201d The god was not well-known, however, dedications have been discovered. Another god, Rigonemetis, \u201cking of the sacred grove,\u201d was also likened to the Roman god of war, Mars. Rigru Roisclethan (R\u00edgru Rosclethan), an Irish female figure from the Otherworld, cried out terribly and led a lowing cow before King Conn of the Hundred Battles while appearing to him once near Tara. The woman warned the king, who had made an attempt on her son\u2019s life, that as long as the licentious queen B\u00e9 Chuma remained in power, the land would suffer."
