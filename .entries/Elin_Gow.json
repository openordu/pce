    "text": "In Irish mythology, the tale of the Glas Ghaibhleann details the story of a magical cow that provided an abundant supply of milk, ensuring that her owner would never go hungry. The cow was owned by a Smith, who was sometimes identified as the deity Goibniu, and other times referred to as Elin Gow. Despite being a lowly smith, Elin Gow attempted to win the hand of the Spanish king's daughter, who at the time possessed the Glas Ghaibhleann. Elin's task to marry the princess was to tend to the magical cow, a task which had proven impossible for others before him, because the cow moved too quickly. Failing to do so meant not only losing the cow and the princess but his life as well. However, to everyone's surprise, Elin Gow was able to keep up with the cow for an impressive seven years. He then brought the cow to Ireland and hired a man named Cian to look after it. Unfortunately, Cian fell asleep one day, and the cow was stolen by the evil Fomorian king, Balor. Despite this setback, the story has a happy ending. Cian was able to retrieve the cow and eventually had a tryst with Balor's imprisoned daughter, Eithne, who later gave birth to the hero Lugh."
