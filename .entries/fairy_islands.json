    "text": "Enchanted Islands in the western ocean have been a folklore subject known as the fairy islands. They are commonly recognized as the location for the Otherworld or Fairyland. These islands were said to be drifting around, without being anchored to any particular place or time, but were seen at intervals and in different locations. Every seven years, a fairy island appeared to the southwest of Rathlin O\u2019Birne island, off the coast of Co. Donegal. It was believed that this land could be settled, brought into this world by landing live embers onto it."
