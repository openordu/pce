    "text": "E\u00f3gan M\u00f3r, also known as E\u00f3gan Ta\u00eddlech, E\u00f3gan Fitheccach, and Mug Nuadat, was a king of Munster, a southwestern province of Ireland. He was married to Beare, a legendary Spanish princess whose name was given to the Beare peninsula. Scholars believe that Beare potentially represents an ancient god related to the land. E\u00f3gan engaged in continuous warfare against Conn of the Hundred Battles, particularly at the border of their respective territories. Despite temporarily fleeing to Spain when Conn invaded, E\u00f3gan returned to fight once more. However, he was ultimately defeated and killed by Conn, his enemy for many years."
