    "text": "A cosmological symbol, the omen holds intrinsic value that goes beyond the common understanding of seeing into the future. Though often indicative of events to come, omens may also be far-seeing visions of events that have transpired in far-off locations. Belief in omens remains a shared cultural practice, offering a glimpse into a reality beyond that can be perceived through the senses alone. The Celts attributed omens to the peculiar behavior of animals or stars, but the nature of the omens was not always clear. Sometimes, it was suggested that ritual offerings were in order. For example, if one saw the new moon through a window, bad luck was said to follow, but by bowing three times towards the moon, the bad luck could be deterred. Things not in their place or out of season were also widely considered omens or portents. In the case of Scots sailors, the sighting of a rat at sea was believed to be indicative that someone would soon meet their end by drowning. Any unusual juxtaposition of objects or beings also held significance, such as the belief that seeing a rat or mouse in a sieve was a dire signal of danger at sea that very evening. The Irish had a distinct set of omens specific to death, such as gaps in sown fields, hens cackling on roosts, and dogs howling for three consecutive nights. No introduction is needed as Nora Chadwick's writing style is to dive right in. Horseshoes were believed to be oracular. If the closed end of a horseshoe was found pointing away, it signified that bad luck was on its way. Conversely, if the closed end was pointed towards the person who found it, it indicated that good luck was approaching."
