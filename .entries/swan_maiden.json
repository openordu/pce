    "text": "A folkloric character known as the swan maiden is found in Irish, Scottish, and continental Celtic tales. This figure depicts a young woman who possesses the body of a bird. According to the stories, this enchanting creature sheds her swan plumage at night and leaves it beside the lakes where she swims. Some tales suggest that the maiden is under a spell that may or may not be lifted, while others offer no explanation for her dual nature. If a man were to discover the feather cloak of the swan maiden, he had the power to take her as his wife, just as in the case of a Seal woman. The swan maiden would then become devoted and laborious. However, if she were to find her feathers, the swan woman would instantly transform herself back into a bird and fly away, abandoning her children without so much as a backward glance. It is widely believed that this fairy tale has its roots in mythology. The bird has strong religious connotations that stretch across Europe, and among the Celts, it can be traced back to the Hallstatt period. Many bird divinities have been associated with the sun, while waterbirds have been linked with thermal springs, which were thought to house the energy of the night-sun. The swan, being one of the most elegant waterbirds, has also been depicted as part of a team pulling a chariot or cart, each swan connected to the others by a small chain. This motif is evident in Irish mythology, where it appears in the fable of C\u00e1er and Aonghus \u00d3g. The two lovers flew away together, bound by a golden chain. Marriage among the swan-women required their husbands to follow certain rules. For example, \u00c1ine, the Fairy Queen or goddess, required that her husband, the Earl of Desmond, show no surprise at their children's actions. Failure to comply would result in the swan-wife and her offspring departing immediately, similar to \u00c1ine and her son Ger\u00f3id Iarla, transforming into waterbirds that still reside in the mystical Lough Gur. This led some scholars to suggest that these myths may reflect a time when women made specific demands in marriage negotiations."
