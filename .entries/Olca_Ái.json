    "text": "Irish mythology speaks of Olca \u00c1i, a heroic figure who once terrified the women in the capital of Connacht, Ireland's western province, leading them to flee across the land and ultimately drown themselves upon reaching a large body of water. It is said that the lake in which they perished was named after their leader, Erne. Scholars have also identified rough-hewn stone sculptures located on White Island in Lough Erne as potentially representing the giant and one of the maidens."
