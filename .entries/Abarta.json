    "text": "An Irish god known as Abarta (also known as \u00c1bartach or \u00c1bhartach) is a minor figure in Irish mythology who belongs to the Fomorians, a race that is ancient and monstrous. Texts that cover the exploits of the Fianna, a band of heroes, describe Abarta's character. Eager to join the warrior elite, Abarta approached them pretending to be an idle man in search of work. Although Fionn Mac Cumhaill, the leader of the Fianna, had no logical reason to take him into service, he indeed agreed and called him \"Gialla Deacair,\" which means \"lazy servant.\" With his apparently feeble old horse, Abarta deceived the Fianna and took them away to the Otherworld, where he held them hostage. Fionn, after many magical adventures and battles, managed to locate and free them. Subsequently, Fionn did not grant Abarta membership in his band following this crime."
