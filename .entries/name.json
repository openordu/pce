    "text": "The act of naming is a powerful one that holds great significance in many cultures. This is exemplified in the Christian creation myth where Adam and Eve were deemed worthy of the responsibility of giving names to all animals they encountered. Naming a child is also considered an important act; indeed, Roman writers attest to the fact that in Celtic Gaul, it was the Druids who conducted naming ceremonies. Some Irish texts even speak of a sort of baptism where babies were immersed in streams or holy wells as they were given their names. This practice was not easily replaced by the Christian rite. In the Hebrides, children were sprinkled with drops of water immediately after birth, and a temporary name was given to the newborn. In Celtic lands where the world's power was held in high esteem, the very sound of a name held great importance. Speaking a name was even forbidden at certain times. Scottish fishermen at sea would not speak the proper names of seabirds they saw as portents of bad luck. Similarly, names of villages were not mentioned directly, and instead were referred to obliquely in order to safeguard those who lived there from the danger posed by Fairies or other supernatural beings. Even in Scotland, people did not speak the name of a newborn child until the child was baptized, and thereby protected from potential Fairy Kidnapping. The practice of giving nicknames or pet names to people similarly arises from the belief that fairy people could cause harm to a loved one if they knew the person's true name."
