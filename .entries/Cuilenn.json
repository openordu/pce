    "text": "Cuilenn, also known as Cullen or Culann, was a renowned hero in Irish mythology. He lent his name to an extraordinary geographical feature in Northern Ireland, the Ring of Gullion, composed of a vast circle of mountains formed by ancient volcanic activity. Slieve Gullion, a mountain located at the center of the ring, was believed to be Cuilenn's dwelling place. However, according to local folklore, the Cailleach also resided there, beneath the Cairn positioned at the top of the summit. At the summit of the mountain, there is a lake that has a legend associated with it, which states that anyone who swims in the lake will have their hair turn grey. The Fairy Queen \u00c1ine\u2019s sister, Milucra, lured Fionn Mac Cumhaill, the legendary Irish hero, to swim in the lake as part of a challenge to prove his courage. Since \u00c1ine had vowed not to engage in relations with a silver-haired man, and Milucra wanted Fionn for herself, she sought to make Fionn unappealing by utilizing a spell. Milucra created a small lake at the summit of the mountain and tricked Fionn into swimming in it. Upon emerging from the lake, Fionn's hair turned silver, and he grew old and bowed. His army, the Fianna, captured Milucra and compelled her to provide Fionn with a potion for healing from her golden Cornucopia. Despite this, she ensured that his hair remained silver. While some accounts suggest that Cuilenn saved Fionn by giving him a restorative potion from a golden cup, others say that he bestowed Fionn with wisdom."
