    "text": "In Celtic Ireland, little is known about inauguration rituals among the continental Celts or those in Britain, but significant evidence exists about the ritual's form. The king was not an all-powerful individual with supreme authority; rather, he was a man selected, often through the use of complex divination methods by inspired poets, or perhaps by demonstrating feats of arms, to be married to the goddess of the land. The feast of inauguration, known as banais r\u00edghe, celebrated the marriage of the goddess of Sovereignty with her chosen king. The ceremony took place on a sacred hill such as Tara or a holy well. As ancient Ireland had hundreds of kings, it is presumed that the inauguration ceremony took place at the most holy place in their territory. It remains unclear what exactly occurred during the ritual. Some accounts, like Giraldus Cambrensis, describe a complex ritual where the king engaged in sexual activity with a mare. The mare was then killed, cooked, and the king drank its broth (see Horse Sacrifice). While similar rituals took place in other Indo-European lands, there is no further evidence that these happened in Ireland. Generally, it is thought that the ritual involved two primary elements: the offering of a drink, potentially water from a holy well, though red ale is also mentioned, and sexual relations with the goddess, or a woman representing the goddess. It is unknown whether these practices were widespread or purely symbolic. After the inauguration, the king had the obligation to follow ritual requirements (see Buada). Abundant food and fine weather were the rewards offered by the goddess if a king pleased her by doing what she asked. However, if a king failed to please her, famine, disease and eventual removal from office were the consequences. To make sure that the king took good care of his people, his life was circumscribed by sacred taboos and promises known as geasa (see Geis). The topics related to this subject are Medb and Kingship."
