    "text": "A site of great Irish mythological importance lies near a small town in Western Ireland called Keshcorran. This site is home to a cave that is said to be inhabited by three terrifying Hags. According to legend, these caves were once connected underground to the most important natural cave in Ireland, known as Oweynagat, which was the dwelling place of the phantom queen M\u00f3rr\u00edgan. Despite stories of a woman being led through the caves by a calf to whom she was clinging, there is no actual connection between the caves. Local people claim that the passage was stopped up by the Devil to explain the discrepancy between fact and fable. The cave plays a significant role in the story Buidhean Ch\u00e9ise Corainn, which recounts the Fight of Keshcorran, where the great hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill was held captive by powerful hags or goddesses who were members of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, the ancient divinities of the land. Other tales of the Fianna associate Fionn with the cave, calling it his original home, while some stories claim that it was the abode of a magical Smith. Even the radiant goddess \u00c1ine was said to have lived there in disguise as a hag, demonstrating the deep mythological significance of Keshcorran despite the confusion and conflicting stories."
