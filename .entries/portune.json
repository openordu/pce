    "text": "A British folkloric figure who is often mentioned is the portune. This tiny fairy that looks like a wrinkled and wizened BROWNIE is thrilled to offer assistance on farms as long as no payment is offered, and their torn and wrinkled coats aren't exchanged. Due to their strength, they were often used for tasks, such as dragging heavy loads. To sustain themselves, Portunes survive on roasted frog meat. Even though the name may have originated from a mispronunciation of the sea Roman god \"Neptune,\" portunes have no links to the ocean. Sometimes the portune would become naughty and demonstrate their Fairy nature by leading horses into swamps, laughing uncontrollably as they tried to escape."
