    "text": "A figure in Irish folklore, the p\u00e9ist (also known as bruckee) is a monstrous serpent or reptile that features in various legends, often being subdued by St. Patrick. Typically associated with freshwater bodies, particularly lakes, the p\u00e9ist can only be defeated while submerged. Locally referred to as the OLLIPHEISt, these creatures are particularly prevalent in the Burren region of west Co. Clare, where one can find place-names like Poulnapeasta, which means \u201cwater dragon\u2019s lair\u201d or \u201cp\u00e9ist-hole\u201d. Near Corofin, a pool that changed color and had several funnel holes was believed to house a monster that was brown, hairy, and had big eyes."
