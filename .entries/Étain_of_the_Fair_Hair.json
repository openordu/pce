    "text": "A fairy woman by the name of \u00c9tain of the Fair Hair, also known as Fholtfhild, resided in the Hill of Howth near Dublin. This hill was named after her father, \u00c9tar. \u00c9tain, who was married to a mortal man, suffered from grief upon his death and subsequently passed away. Another fairy woman, also named \u00c9tain of the Fair Hair, lived in the sea with her father, Manann\u00e1n Mac Lir, who was the sea god. Her sister, Cl\u00eddna of the waves, also resided with them within this domain."
