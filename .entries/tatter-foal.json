    "text": "A British folkloric figure, known as the tatter-foal or shag-foal, was believed to be a type of Bogey or bogle. This figure was known for its ability to shape-shift, as described in Shape-Shifting, and could take on many forms, including that of a monkey. However, its most common form was that of a shaggy baby horse."
