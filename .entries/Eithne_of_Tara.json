She was married to multiple kings of Tara, including Conn of the Hundred Battles and his grandson, Cormac Mac Airt, with whom she had a son named Cairbre Lifechair. During her reign at Tara, the fields yielded three crops annually, indicating that she was a manifestation of the Sovereignty goddess."
