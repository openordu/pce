    "text": "The Celtic holiday, Samhain (Sauwin, Samuin, Samain, Sauin, Samonios), was one of four major holidays celebrated by the Celts, each corresponding to a different season of the year. Imbolc, which occurred on February 1, marked the start of spring, Beltane on May 1 signaled the arrival of summer, and Lughnasa on August 1 celebrated the fall harvest season. However, the most significant of these holidays was Samhain, celebrated on November 1st as the beginning of winter. Folklore suggests that during Samhain, the people of the Otherworld entered our world and with their breath, blighted vegetation, causing everything to wilt away. The day following the celebration was thought to leave nothing green and growing. Similar to New Year\u2019s, the year was believed to begin with winter as the Celtic day started at sundown. Scholars disagree on whether these holidays were celebrated throughout the entirety of Celtic regions, citing the appropriateness of the seasons to Irish culture. Some argue that the traditional Celtic holidays were purely Irish celebrations, while others posit that the festivals found among the Celtic Irish were likely celebrated by other Celtic cultures. Despite this contention, of all the Celtic holidays, Samhain is the most commonly observed, having transformed into the modern children\u2019s holiday, Halloween. Halloween continues to be celebrated with costumes, decorations, and pranks. Christianized as All Saints\u2019 Day, the festival spread to the New World and beyond, being adopted by regions such as North America and areas invaded by the Spanish, including those with Galician Celtic roots, where the holiday developed into D\u00eda de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead. Samhain, one of the Celtic feasts, is believed to be the most enduring and prevalent among them. The feast played a crucial role in the agricultural calendar in two ways. Firstly, it marked the day when pigs were slaughtered, which added to the festival's scary nature with the sound of desperate squealing. However, it also meant seasonal treats like blood pudding were available. Secondly, cows were brought down from the mountains to winter pastures on Samhain after six months with their milkmaids. In Ireland, this tradition of moving animals to and from seasonal pastures continued well into modern times. It is unknown how the festival was initially celebrated, but Irish mythological texts suggest that consumption of alcoholic beverages was a part of the feast. All tales featuring drunkenness, such as The Intoxication Of The Ulstermen, The Adventure of Nera, and the F\u00e9is Temro (which described the feast of kingly Inauguration), occurred during Samhain. It is possible that grain from the recent harvest was brewed as there is archaeological evidence of brewing vats. It is also possible this mixture was drunk during the Samhain season given the lack of storage vessels similar to those from wine-making regions. Life returned to normal after the ale was finished until the next Samhain. Hilltop fires were lit on other Celtic feasts, and there is some evidence of a fire on Samhain, although not at the hill of Tara despite its connection to the festival in mythology. The central fire for the Samhain festival has been suggested to be the nearby hill of Tlachtga in Co. Meath. Similarly, Uisneach has been proposed as the fire for the opposite feast of Beltane. Samhain, celebrating the end of the harvest, was not only an occasion for plentiful food but also dread. Winter was approaching and its unpredictable forces were feared despite the gathered food. Hence, divination rituals were probably part of the event from ancient times. Although we have limited knowledge of the ancient celebration of Samhain, we have enough evidence that suggests how it was viewed by later cultures. There are countless stories of ghosts and legends linked to the holiday when the veil between this and the Otherworld was lifted, and even those without second sight could see the Fairies and the dead coming forth. On Samhain, Fairies were particularly likely to abduct humans. Therefore, people remained near their homes, carried iron or salt, or turned their clothing inside out for protection. On the Wild Hunt, the Fairies marched out in droves from their Fairy Mounds, traveling through the night as they attempted to abduct people on the road. As a result, it was seen as unwise to walk near a fairy mound on Samhain night more than on typical nights. The dead also emerged from graveyards to revisit their old homes. Some traditions claim that they were friendly and seeking the usual pleasures of human life once more, while others viewed the returning dead as dangerous. A \"dumb supper\" of the favorite dishes of the departed was set out by those who viewed the dead as friendly; they awaited their return with respect and only a tiny amount of fear, pointing out the next day's empty plates as evidence of the visit. Those who viewed the dead as a hazard believed that they were likely to abduct beloved ones and carry them into the Otherworld of death, similar to the fairies. On the Isle of Man, fairies were said to specialize in abducting people during Samhain (on the opposite feast of Beltane, they were more interested in stealing Milk and other animal products). This was also a night of divination. Women created Soddag valloo (\"dumb Cake\") on Samhain night. After baking directly on the embers of the hearth fire, the cake was eaten in quiet by the young women of the household. They then retreated to their beds while facing the fire, in the expectation of dreaming of their intended lovers. Such divination was a typical component of Samhain rituals. Girls hid beside a neighbor's house with water in their mouths and a pinch of salt in each hand as they listened for the names of eligible youthful men. The girl who heard the name of the first one spoken would marry him. Nuts were burned in the hearth, and the patterns they produced were interpreted for future indications. Inquirers' future vocations were indicated by the shapes formed when molten lead was poured into water. Amongst those born on Samhain, it was thought that they had natural abilities in divination throughout their lives. If they were born possessing a Caul or any other sign of spiritual strength, they tended to be revered and feared. Reports have been made regarding the presence of a deity known as Samhain, Cian's brother, who lost the Glas Ghaibhleann, the great Cow of abundance, to Balor of the Evil Eye, a malicious Fomorian king. However, many are unable to locate any records of such a being."
