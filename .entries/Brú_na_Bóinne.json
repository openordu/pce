    "text": "A mythological site in Ireland called Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne (Brug na B\u00f3inne) features three magnificent rock mounds along the banks of the River Boyne, situated between Slane and Drogheda in the east central region of the country. Knowth, Dowth, and Newgrange are the three huge tumuli that each surround an inner passageway of Standing Stones adorned with Spirals, sunbursts, and stars. These stones are held in place by massive boulders, and the central mound, Newgrange, is surrounded by a circle of standing stones. These structures were constructed around 5,000 years ago by unknown people, long before the arrival of the Celts in Ireland, almost three millennia later. The Megalithic Civilization, which was responsible for erecting Avebury and Stonehenge much later than these Irish sites, also built these mammoth monuments. The engineering and astronomical knowledge possessed by the builders of Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne remain unmatched to this day. The great central mound, Newgrange, is precisely aligned to the winter Solstice sunrise and incorporates an understanding of the earth\u2019s wobble or the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, which humanity only rediscovered in the last century. Furthermore, these impressive structures are designed to have repelled rainfall for over six thousand years, thanks to an efficient system of gutters that directs the water away from the inner chambers. Although the Celts who came to Ireland later were not responsible for the construction of the mounds, they created legends around these sites, which they may have used for their rituals or burials. Newgrange was the palace (Br\u00fa) of B\u00f3and, the goddess of the river who resided underneath the mound. B\u00f3and, also known as Eithne, was the first to live there along with Elcmar (sometimes known as Elcmar and Nechtan). The Dagda was asked by a female figure, who chooses not to be named in the writing, to be her lover. Her proposal to the Dagda was that he would be required to hold the sun motionless in the sky for nine months, allowing her to carry a child for the duration of a single day. This deceitful plan was executed successfully, leading to the safe birth of a child named Aonghus \u00f3g. In the future, Aonghus \u00f3g would trick his father into leaving the Br\u00fa so that he could inhabit it. The remaining two mounds on this site, Dowth and Knowth, are not as significant in Celtic mythology; furthermore, there is minimal knowledge of their corresponding astronomical alignment. It is speculated that Dowth, which means \"darkness\" or \"darkening,\" is marginally smaller than the other mounds, yet characterized with two intricate inner chambers. Conversely, Knowth is home to unchallenged rock art throughout Europe and has recently been made accessible to the public."
