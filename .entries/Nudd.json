    "text": "British god Nudd (also known as Lludd) was associated with a great temple belonging to the Roman era that was dedicated to a deity called Nodens, who is thought to be the same as Welsh god Nudd or Lludd. Scholars believe that given the temple\u2019s location and the depiction of Nudd surrounded by tritons, symbols of the sea, Nudd represented the god of the River\u2019s mouth or estuary, and possibly the headlands around it. Welsh mythology portrays Nudd (or Lludd) as Britain\u2019s ruler and the brother of the Continent\u2019s king, Llefelys. Although he founded London, Nudd\u2019s reign was marred with multiple problems. The kingdom was attacked first by demons, then two dragons, and then by a large magician. However, Nudd, with the help of his brother, was able to overcome all the difficulties that came his way."
