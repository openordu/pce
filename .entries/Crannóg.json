    "text": "An archaeological site called Crann\u00f3g was home to early settlements in Celtic territories. These settlements were often built on artificial islands made of brush and encircled by wattle fences. The residents of Crann\u00f3g took advantage of the protection provided by the lake and its life-sustaining properties. There is evidence to suggest that the development of circular dwellings on such lake settlements was initiated during pre-Celtic times. These structures continued to be used up to and including the early Christian era, and in some cases were still utilized as late as the 17th century C.E. Visitors can view some restored crann\u00f3gs in historical parks, with notable examples located at Cragganowen near Ennis, Co. Clare, in Ireland."
