    "text": "Cormac mac Airt, a notable Irish hero, was the king of Tara during the time when the land prospered with heavy-grained fields, overflowing rivers, and an abundance of milk from Cows. Fionn Mac Cumhaill, a warrior and leader of the band of Fianna, lived under Cormac's reign. As with most heroes, Cormac's existence began with various mysterious signs. On his way to Mag Mucrama for a gruesome battle that inevitably led to Art Mac Cuinn's death, his father stopped at a blacksmith's home. The smith prophesized that any child conceived by his daughter Achtan would become a king. Art slept with Achtan, and before departing the next morning, he instructed her that any resulting child should be fostered in Connacht. When Achtan went into labor and traveled across Ireland during a thunderstorm to fulfill Art's request, she gave birth to Cormac under a hedgerow. The young boy survived with the help of a wolf that adopted him while his mother sought help; he grew up in the wilderness and became king, as the prophecy foretold. To take the throne, Cormac first had to wed Medb Lethderg, who also happened to be the Sovereignty figure married to his grandfather and father. Despite various Otherworld beauties offered by the sea god Manann\u00e1n Mac Lir, Cormac rejected their propositions and returned to the Earthly realm bringing a magical golden cup. This enchanted cup broke whenever lies were spoken in its presence but mended itself when truth was told. A king of great renown, Cormac was forced to abdicate his throne due to disfigurement after engaging in a fight with another king at Tara. The reason for this fight was due to the fact that Cormac's son, Cellach, had raped the daughter of the other king. During the altercation, Cormac lost his eye; since it is unacceptable for a king to be blemished, he relinquished his power to his son, Cairbre Lifechair."
