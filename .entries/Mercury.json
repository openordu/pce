    "text": "Mercury is a Celtic god who was worshipped in both Britain and the Continent. When the Roman legions arrived in the region, many of the Celtic gods, who were localized to specific tribes or regions, were given new names based on Roman gods. It is unclear whether the many gods who were renamed \"Mercury\" were similar in nature, or what the original powers of this god were. According to Caesar, Mercury was the most popular god among the Celts and was frequently depicted in art. Unlike the Celtic war god, Mars, Mercury was a god of trade and prosperity. He was often depicted carrying a bag of money, indicating his success in commercial transactions. Mercury was occasionally portrayed as a messenger of the gods, although this was a rare concept in Celtic mythology, as he was primarily associated with trading and commerce. He was also connected with Rosmerta, a water goddess who was worshipped for healing in Gaul. Mercury was often depicted wearing a Torc, a twisted neck-piece that symbolized power and prestige. He was sometimes shown with a winged double-snake caduceus, a classical emblem associated with healing, which suggested that he possessed the power of healing. While it is difficult to determine Mercury's original identity, several gods have been suggested as possible candidates for his original Celtic character. The poet Lucan describes Teutates, the god of the tribe, and Esus, the woodland god, using the name Mercury. Various local names have been preserved such as Mercury Artaios, who is associated with \u201cbear\u201d or \u201cploughed land,\u201d Mercury Arvernorix, who is linked to Avernus, Mercury Cimiacinus, who is considered to be a god of roads in Britain, Mercury Cissonius, Mercury Cultor, or \u201cthe farmer,\u201d Mercury Dumaitis, also known as Dumias and associated with \u201chill\u201d or \u201cmound,\u201d Mercury Iovantucarus, and Mercury Visucius. One inscription in France mentions Mercury Moccus, who may be related to the concept of \u201cPig.\u201d"
