    "text": "Fedelm, the Fairy in charge of taking care of the future monarch of Cashel, Corc Mac Luigthic, had performed a rite with her siblings that caused the latter to be identified by fire. Some believe that the name Fedelm could have referred to a typical name given to female fortune tellers, and there is evidence to support this claim. For example, there is an ancient Celtic inscription that mentions a group of witches or prophets that goes by the name of Gaulish Uidula, which was discovered in a woman's grave. Despite the tough interpretation of the text, it seems to allude to a group of magical women who were connected in some way."
