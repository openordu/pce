    "text": "A Scottish and Irish phenomenon of folklore is the fetch (feach). It was believed that each person had their own detachable aura or shell that resembled their physical body and could wander as a spectral entity. Encountering one's fetch had varying significance; seeing oneself in the morning was an indication of forthcoming good fortune, while spotting one's own image in the evening or near a burial ground was a bad omen of death. The individuals possessing Second Sight had the ability to perceive fetches of others besides their own. It appears the fetch was separate from the Cowalker, which could either be a Fairy or ghost rather than an aura."
