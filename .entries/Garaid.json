    "text": "An Irish hero named Garaid was mentioned in the Fenian Cycle. In this tale, the women who were part of Fionn Mac Cumhaill's court were afraid that Garaid might make inappropriate advances towards them. As a result, they resorted to tying his beard and hair to the walls of their home while he was sleeping. Garaid woke up suddenly and tried to free himself. In the process of doing so, he ended up ripping off his own scalp. This made him extremely angry and he burned down the house, located near Mullingar at Drumcree, along with all the women inside. He further delighted in their demise."
