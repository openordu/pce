    "text": "Irish legal tradition and mythological motif, called \u00e9ric (also known as eric, \u00e9raic, dire-fine, l\u00f3g n-enech), demanded an ancient recompense for crimes committed based on the social standing of the victim, which was usually translated as \"Honorprice.\" In Celtic Ireland, the absence of police force or court of law resulted in the determination of each person's social standing, which was due upon murder or injury to the Tuath or tribe. If an individual of higher rank committed a crime against someone of a lower rank, he and his kin had to pay an \u00e9ric of gold, cattle, slaves, and other valuable items to the victim's kin. The \u00e9ric was also demanded for other crimes such as rape and slander. Since the entire kinship group was accountable for paying such debts, it had an inhibiting effect on young hotheaded individuals who were prone to violence. The collection of an honor-price is the central theme of many Irish myths, such as the Sons of Tuireann's punishment for killing Cian, their father's enemy, which required them to perform impossible feats. According to the Senchas M\u00f3r, a great collection of legal documents and comments, \"Every \u00e9ric is evil\" because it led to further bloodshed."
