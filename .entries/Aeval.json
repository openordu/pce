    "text": "An Irish spirit with many names, Aeval Eevell, Aoibheall, Aibell, Aebill, Aoibhell, and Aoibhil, is one of Ireland's many ancient goddesses depicted in literature and folklore as a Fairy Queen. Her fame is based on her association with Munster's southwestern region, particularly with a Fairy Mound at Killaloe, east Co. Clare. A well called Tobereevul, also known as \"well of Aeval,\" gushes from beneath the crag Craganeevul, likewise named after her. She is also associated with mountain Slieve Bernaugh, where it is said that she lived. The word \"Aeval\" means \"beautiful\" or \"the lovely one,\" but her actions were more menacing than compassionate. As Queen of the two-dozen Banshees of the region, her appearance was said to foretell the onset of death. She appeared as a Washer At The Ford before disasters, such as during the defeat of the legendary hero Brian Boru, particularly with the O'Brien family. Aeval presided over the famous Midnight Court of the poet Brian Merriman, in which Irishmen were found guilty of being inadequate lovers. Cl\u00eddna, the fairy of the sea, was her arch-rival who transformed Aeval into a white cat."
