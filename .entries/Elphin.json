    "text": "Elphin, a Welsh hero, was not the most competent individual and had a tendency to find himself in trouble. His father realized this when he discovered that Elphin was spending his inheritance without any thought for the future. As a result, Elphin's father sent him to a fish-weir and informed him that his future wealth would come exclusively from water. On that very day, Taliesin - the famed Welsh poet who had been reborn and had accidentally consumed a magical fluid, making him incomparably wise while he was a servant boy in the home of the goddess Ceridwen - was recovered from the sea, where he had been thrown at birth. Elphin took the child home and raised him with love, and Taliesin demonstrated his gratitude by showing him immense filial devotion. Despite this, Elphin was never able to completely reform his ways and occasionally required rescue from his foster son, who was happy to oblige."
