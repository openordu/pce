    "text": "Blue Men Of The Minch, also known as Fir Ghorm (Fir Gorm), are mythological creatures found in Scottish and Gaelic folklore. A significant part of Scottish folklore is the first footer, also called qualtagh on the Isle of Man, which is the first person or creature met on the road while on the way to a wedding or christening. According to tradition, they are offered bread and cheese to appease spirits and ensure good luck for the new year. In Scotland, and among the Manx, the first footer who enters a house on January 1 should be a dark complexioned man in good health, known as a first footer. Red-headed people are feared as first footers on the Isle of Man because they are believed to be associated with the Fairy realm, but in Scotland, they are considered acceptable. The first footer must bear a gift, as it is believed to bring good fortune, and in return, they are offered food or drink."
