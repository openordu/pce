    "text": "An Irish heroine known as L\u00ed Ban (also known as Liban) featured in The Annals of Ireland during the 17th century, although her story supposedly dates back to the 6th century. She was commonly referred to as \u201cfinest of women\u201d or \u201cbeauty of womanhood.\u201d She was considered the daughter of A\u00e9d Abrat, the king of Tara, or the unknown Ecca (whose mother was \u00c9tain), with no mention of L\u00ed Ban\u2019s mother. Unfortunately, a sacred well was left uncovered by someone, leading to a flood that carried L\u00ed Ban away. The well overflowed and destroyed the entire kingdom of A\u00e9d Abrat, drowning him and most of his family, leaving L\u00ed Ban and her lapdog as the only survivors, living in a bubble underwater for a year. During her time, she observed the playful salmon as they reside comfortably in the water realm, and she soon prayed to become like them. Her wish was granted, and she transformed into a mermaid with a woman\u2019s torso and head and a salmon\u2019s tail. Her dog transformed into an otter, and together, they swam in the waters of Lough Neagh for 300 years, while Ireland became a Christian nation. This theme of transformation is evident in the tales of other maidens, including Fionnuala, and Ois\u00edn's story, who resided in Fairyland with Niamh of the Golden Hair. Eventually, after three centuries, L\u00ed Ban called out to a passing boat crew, pleading with them to capture her and meet her ashore at Inver Ollarbha. In a boat, there was a priest named Beoc who had gone to Rome on an errand and arranged for the capture of a mermaid. The mermaid was pulled up and placed in a half-submerged boat so that she could swim until they had determined what to do with her. Initially, local kings and priests argued over who had the authority to claim her. However, angels instructed them to wait for two oxen or stags to appear, and then to trust that the beasts would carry the maiden to the territory in which she belonged. The miraculous oxen did appear and carried L\u00ed Ban to the church of Priest Beoc. There, she requested baptism so that she could die immediately and ascend to heaven. Her wish was granted, and she was named Murgen, meaning \u201csea-born.\u201d She immediately died and became a Saint, a holy virgin. The blending of pagan and Christian elements reveals how primitive deities were brought into the realm of the new religion. L\u00ed Ban was presumably a goddess once, like B\u00f3and and S\u00ednann, whose myths involve wells that magically overflow. However, under the accumulation of Christian motifs, her original myth is likely irrevocably lost. Another L\u00ed Ban was a Fairy Queen, the ruler of the land of Mag Mell, the honeyed plain, and the sister of the stunning fairy Fand. Alongside her husband, they asked the hero C\u00fachulainn to rescue them from monstrous Fomorians, initiating one of Ireland's greatest love stories. Without introducing the subject, I will state that there was a man who fell in love with Fand despite being married to Emer, who was considered a perfect woman. This love affair was the only one that endangered their otherwise strong marriage. See <TOPIC>."
