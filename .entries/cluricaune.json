    "text": "A being of Irish and Scottish mythology, the cluricaune (also spelled cluricane or cluracan) was quite unlike its fellow fairy, the Leprechaun. Unlike the hardworking Leprechaun, this Solitary Fairy preferred to laze about and flaunt its fancy attire, which included a flashy cap with golden lace, silver-buckled shoes, and a red suit (a typical color for Solitary Fairies, unlike Trooping Fairies who wore green). Fond of alcohol, the cluricaune would sneak into cellars and help itself to bottles, especially those belonging to alcoholics. It was incredibly difficult to remove, as it could easily travel inside a cask if the owner tried to move it. The name cluricaune was used primarily in Co. Cork, while in Co. Kerry, the fairy was known as the Luricaune, and in Tipperary and Ulster, it was called the Lugirgadaune and Loghery Man, respectively. One particular cluricaune, named Little Wildbeam, inhabited a Quaker family in Cork and proved to be most helpful when a servant left a bit of beer dripping from the cask; the fairy would shrink and wedge itself into the spigot to prevent any loss. However, if it was not fed well, the cluricaune would emerge at night and beat the maids senseless. This behavior eventually became too much for the family, who decided to move. To their surprise, when they unpacked at their new home, they found that the cluricaune had followed them there and had no intention of leaving."
