    "text": "In the town of Liscannor, situated near the famed Cliffs of Moher in Ireland, lies a holy Well dedicated to the goddess turned-saint Brigit. Every year on Brigit's feast day, which also happens to be the Celtic feast of Imbolc or spring\u2019s awakening, believers flock to this site. Before visiting the well itself, pilgrims follow a circular path up and down a nearby hillside. The well house, carved into the hillside, features a rocky wall through which the well's waters trickle down, making it a peculiar location. Scholars believe that the original deity to whom this well was devoted was a goddess, rather than a saint, and that it was not Brigit. The dedication of the well to Brigit is a relatively recent phenomenon. Before the 1950s, the pattern day was on Lughnasa, the old Celtic harvest feast on August 1, associated with goddesses such as Tailtiu and the Cailleach. The latter, also known as the Hag of harvest, is said to be connected to the nearby cliffs, known in Irish as Ceann na Caillghe or \u201cthe hag\u2019s head.\u201d Legends say that the hag Mal plunged to her death from the top of the cliffs, which some also associate with the monster called the Ollipheist."
