    "text": "A mythological beast of Irish lore was the impressive white-horned bull known as Finnbennach, also referred to as Findbennach and Fionn Bheannach. In his earlier life, this creature was a swineherd by the name of Rucht, who worked for a man named Ochall Ochne. Rucht and another swineherd, Friuch, had an ongoing quarrel that persisted beyond each of their deaths and resulted in their reincarnations as bitter rivals. Over the years, these two took on the forms of ravens battling in the sky, stags locking horns in the woods, and waterworms in separated streams throughout Ireland. Unable to sustain their skirmishes in these lowly incarnations and with great distance between them, Rucht and Friuch made ready to engage in war once again. They whispered their plans to different leaders, with Rucht advising Queen Medb of Connacht to marry Ailill mac M\u00e1ta and Friuch urging the King of Cuailnge to prepare for conflict over a bull. The two worms infiltrated the bodies of cows, causing them to conceive and give birth to bulls that were, in fact, the reincarnated swineherds. Finnbennach emerged as the most extraordinary bull in Connacht, joining the herd of Queen Medb, but he eventually relocated to the possession of Ailill, Medb's husband, as he felt it was beneath him to be owned by a woman. This caused legal alterations for Medb, who then set out to locate a bull that could rival Finnbennach. Her search led her to the other swineherd, who had been reborn as the powerful brown bull Donn Cuailnge of Ulster. In a fierce battle following the events of Medb's Cattle Raid, the bitter enemies finally came together. Notably, Finnbennach was killed, but not before he gored Donn Cuailnge, leading to the death of the other bull in the process. Chronicled in the Irish epic Tain B\u00f3 Cuailnge, this cattle raid is noteworthy for the shape-shifting and reincarnation that mark the story. These curious elements suggest that the two bulls, who were originally swineherd/water-worms, might have been gods or Bards - beings often prone to exhibiting such behavior. However, the explanatory referents associated with these peculiar characteristics are now lost, leaving behind a story of war and battle that is nothing short of vigorous."
