    "text": "Iseult of the White Hands was a Cornish or Breton heroine. Tristan married Iseult of the White Hands after he was separated from his destined lover, Iseult. Tristan's second marriage did not bring him joy, for upon hearing of the original Iseult's passing, he grew ill and soon passed away. The story highlights hidden meanings as the repetition of Iseult's name suggests a connection to the original Iseult's role as a goddess of Sovereignty. This indicates that Tristan replaced Mark as the goddess's chosen one, perhaps insinuating that the older man was no longer apt to rule as a king."
