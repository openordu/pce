    "text": "Located in Co. Sligo, Gamh (Gam) is a remarkable site with a well that was once considered one of the Mirabilia Hibernia, or the wonders of Ireland, in the medieval times. The well rises from a space within three flagstones on the side of the Tullaghan hill. It is categorized as half-sweet and half-salt and is now dedicated to St. Patrick. The story surrounding the well tells us that it was a result of the saint\u2019s prayer for water during his pursuit of the demon, known variously as Caoranach and the Devil\u2019s Mother. When the well broke through the rocks, Patrick stayed nearby, waiting for the demon to arrive. But when she did, thirsty and ready to drink, her blood caused the well\u2019s water to become bitter. It is commonly believed that the well shelters sacred Salmon that can be caught and eaten but will always be seen swimming in the water the following day. The Dindshenchas, also known as Ireland\u2019s place-name poetry, gives the region around the well the name Sliab Gamh, meaning the mountains of Gamh, after a servant of \u00c9rem\u00f3n who invaded Milesian. Although Gamh was beheaded, it is unclear whether it was a punishment for some wrongdoing or part of a battle. The corrupted story seems to indicate that he was killed for failing to observe agricultural rituals. His head was then thrown into the well, causing the sweet water to turn salty for a part of each day."
