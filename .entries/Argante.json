    "text": "A British heroine or goddess named Argante is believed to be the Queen of the mystical island of Avalon, which is situated in the Otherworld. There have been varying descriptions of her, with some suggesting that she is a manifestation of both Arianrhod and Morgan Le Fay. Legend has it that Argante had the power to cure King Arthur's fatal injuries, and he was brought to her domain for healing. However, the king has not yet returned from her realm."
