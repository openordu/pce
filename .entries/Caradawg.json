    "text": "Caradawg, also known as Carradoc or Caradog, is a hero of Welsh mythology. According to the Mabinogion, he was the son of the revered king, Br\u00e2n The Blessed. Despite being a young prince, Caradawg was left in charge of Wales while his father embarked on a mission to rescue his sister, Branwen, from a cruel and abusive marriage in Ireland. Sadly, Caradawg was unable to protect his father's throne from a usurper named Caswallawn. The treacherous act resulted in the deaths of all royal retainers except Caradawg, who was defeated and filled with an overwhelming sense of heartbreak. Meanwhile, a different Caradawg, also known as Freichfras (\u201cof the strong arm\u201d) or Briefbras (\u201cshort-armed\u201d), emerged as a trusted adviser to King Arthur in literature."
