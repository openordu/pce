    "text": "Irish hero Giona, also known as Giona mac Lugha, had an illustrious family background. As a grandson of the renowned hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill, Giona was expected to lead by example, but his lack of discipline and control made him an uninspiring leader for his warriors. To address this issue, Fionn took Giona under his guidance and transformed him into a formidable hero of the Fianna."
