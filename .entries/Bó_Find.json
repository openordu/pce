    "text": "A magical white Cow named B\u00f3 Find emerged with her sisters, B\u00f3 Ruadh and B\u00f3 Dhu, from the western sea when Ireland was an infertile and unpopulated island. The red cow, B\u00f3 Ruadh, traveled north while the black cow, B\u00f3 Dhu, headed south, with B\u00f3 Find travelling to the center of the island. The three cows brought life to Ireland as they traveled their separate ways. Upon arrival at the center of the island, B\u00f3 Find gave birth to twin calves that were male and female, and all of Ireland's Cattle are said to have descended from them. Several sites along her path still bear names that include \"B\u00f3,\" including the famous island of Inis B\u00f3 Find, now known as Inisbofin, which is considered sacred. For more on this topic, please see B\u00f3and."
