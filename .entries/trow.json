    "text": "A popular Scottish folkloric character is the trow, commonly depicted as fairies on the Shetland and Orkney Islands. They share many similarities with Scandinavian trolls, and it is likely that their name comes from this origin. Like trolls, trows also preferred to be active at night and did not like sunlight. However, unlike trolls, the effects of sunlight only resulted in temporary paralysis, and the trows would awaken at nightfall. Two kinds of trows existed: sea trows that primarily lived underwater and land trows that were either human-sized gray fairies or giants. When encountering them on the road, they walked backward instead of towards you. Although seeing a trow was viewed as unfortunate, catching them conversing with each other was seen as a sign of good luck."
