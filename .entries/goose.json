    "text": "The goose holds significant symbolic value for the Celts, both the wild and the tame varieties being endowed with mythological significance (including the Barnacle Goose). The barnyard goose, known for its aggressive tendencies, was particularly associated with both male and female warrior divinities. Examples of stone geese were found in the temples of Gaul while bronze representations of war goddesses with goose-head helmets were produced in Brittany. In an ironic twist, the Celtic siege of Rome was brought to an end when Juno Moneta's temple's geese raised such a ruckus that the Roman defenders were alerted and the invading Celts subsequently defeated. The goose was so closely identified with the Celtic people that it became a taboo food among the Britons, reserved for divinatory purposes and consumed only during ritual observances. Some Fairy creatures had the ability to metamorphose into geese, as did the waterbird-hero Geroid Iarla."
