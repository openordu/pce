    "text": "A renowned Irish hero named Goidel, also known as Gadelus, Gael, Gaedhal Glas, or Gathelus, is believed to be a fictional character as opposed to a real deity. He is considered the forefather of the Goidelic, or Gaelic, Celts of Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of Man. According to a complex text that has undergone significant Christianization, Goidel was the grandson of an Egyptian Pharaoh and was healed of an ailment during his childhood by none other than Moses of the Bible. Edmund Spenser, a poet and a propagandist, recounts that Goidel, or Gathelus, was the offspring of Cecrops of Argos, a Greek king from mythology who tied the knot with an Egyptian princess and accompanied her to Spain, where they parented the Irish race. Some hold the view that Goidel and M\u00edl (see Milesians) refer to the same character, but he is also known to be one of Mil's sons or descendants. His progenitor, Rifath Scot, became a speaker of Scots Gaelic due to the turmoil at the biblical Tower of Babel, while Goidel fashioned the Irish language by amalgamating words from the remaining 72 languages he was familiar with."
