    "text": "In Irish legend, there was a princess named Ailinn (also spelled Aillinn or Aillin). She was a major figure in one of the greatest love stories of Ireland. Her lover was Baile Binnbh\u00e9arlach, who was a prince from Ulster in the northeast. The two of them planned to meet midway between their provinces, but a Fairy with evil intentions told Baile that Ailinn was dead. He was so heartbroken that he died of grief on the shore of Baile's Strand near Dundalk. The Fairy then went to Ailinn to tell her the same story, which was tragically true in her case, and she died of grief as well. The death of the two lovers brought forth two intertwined trees, a yew from Baile's grave and an apple tree from Ailinn's. After seven years, poets carved the trees into two magical tablets, one with all of Ulster's tragic love songs engraved on yew and the other with Leinster's recorded on applewood. The tablets brought their provinces closer together, much like the lovers had once been. A different version of the story suggests that Ailinn was kidnapped and raped, dying of shame over her treatment. An apple tree sprouted from her resting place, while a nearby yew grew from the grave of her cherished dog, Baile."
