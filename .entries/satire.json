    "text": "Irish ritual had a form of satire that was distinctly different from its modern definition as a literary work that uses wit and irony to discredit vice and folly. Satire in ancient Ireland had a more urgent moral purpose and was specifically presented in a poetic form. Jonathan Swift's \"A Modest Proposal,\" widely considered the greatest satirical work in post-Celtic Irish literature, shared many similarities with its ancient predecessor. Unlike contemporary satire that can be used playfully or maliciously to expose political injustices, satire in Celtic Ireland had a more precise and calculated target, and its impact was meant to change society. The Bard, whose power was meant to balance that of the king (see Kingship), was tasked with ensuring that the king upheld his sacred vows and offered generous hospitality to all, as dictated by Buada and Geis, which were sacred to the goddess of the land's sovereignty. Failure to live by these vows could result in famine or barrenness, and it was the poet's responsibility to create a powerful satire that would cause physical deformation or boils on the king's face. This would render the king unable to fulfill his duties, leading to his eventual removal from power. Mythical tales in Irish folklore, such as the expulsion of Bres mac Elatha from the kingship of Tara and the story of Aithirne, a bitter poet who caused difficulties, highlight the importance of satire in Irish society. As satire was legally considered a form of assault, it must be employed with precision and care. A customary compensation known as the honor price, or \u00c9ric, was expected to be paid in situations involving undeserved satire. These included creating derogatory aliases, repeating satires authored by others, and ridiculing a person's physical traits. In accordance with ancient legal writings that dealt with what we refer to as libel, the satire had to be based on factual information. The act of composing satires posthumously was illegal due to the underlying purpose of the satire not being mere malice. As a result, any such compositions necessitated payment of the full honor price of the individual to their relatives (refer to Fine). In cases where the satire was based on fact, the poet was obliged to make amends\u2014however, a laudatory poem would suffice and counteract the damage inflicted by the satire."
