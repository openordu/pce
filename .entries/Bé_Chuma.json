    "text": "A goddess or heroine in Irish mythology, B\u00e9 Chuma (also spelled Bechuma, B\u00e9 Cuma, B\u00e9 cuma) was a member of the mystical race of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, renowned for her insatiable desires. Hailing from the Otherworld, she abandoned her powerful husband for another man, which led to her banishment from her realm to ours. Her capriciousness continued on this earth, as she yearned for her stepson Art Mac Cuinn while being married to the king of Tara, Conn of the Hundred Battles. As the queen of Tara symbolized the authority over the land, B\u00e9 Chuma had the ability to replace a king with another. Rather than seizing the opportunity, she was sent away from Tara when Art came back with his wife and demanded B\u00e9 Chuma's banishment."
