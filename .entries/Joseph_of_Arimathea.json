    "text": "The character of Joseph of Arimathea, an Arthurian hero, has a notable role in the Grail story even though he is not well-documented in the Christian Bible. At his residence, the Savior Jesus had his Last Supper before his death, where the Grail was utilized as part of the dinner service. This object was sanctified with the miracle of transubstantiation in which bread and wine become the body and blood of the Christian God\u2019s son. As the only disciple of Jesus who had enough money to bury his master after the crucifixion, Joseph had an important role to play. In return for his invaluable services, Pontius Pilate, who had ordered Jesus' execution, gave Joseph the Grail. However, the story is not consistent at this point because it is unlikely that Joseph would need to be compensated with his own cup or platter. He then embarked on an extensive journey across the Mediterranean where he carried the Grail with him and converted people to the new religion of Jesus. Ultimately, he settled in Britain where he had previously traveled with Jesus as a child. Joseph had many chances to visit the rich tin mines of Cornwall but chose to settle in Glastonbury where, on Wearyall Hill, he thrust his staff into the ground and it blossomed despite the winter weather. A miracle gave Joseph the assurance to stay and he proceeded to construct the initial church in Britain for Christians in that location."
