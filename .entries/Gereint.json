    "text": "Gereint, also known as Keraint or Gereint fab Erbin, was a legendary Welsh hero who, along with his wife Enid, was believed to embody the ideal model of a loving and devoted couple. However, historical accounts suggest that their relationship may not have been as perfect as it seemed. Gereint was purportedly Arthur's cousin, and he won Enid's hand in marriage by serving her father, who was a king. After their union, Gereint became preoccupied with leisure and neglected his kingdom to the point where both his subjects and Enid expressed their discontent. Unfortunately, instead of heeding their criticisms, Gereint punished his wife by accusing her of infidelity after she repeated the same complaints. In an effort to debunk the rumors of Enid's perceived infidelity, Gereint dragged her with him everywhere and demanded that she remain silent at all times, leading to their peril. Despite her repeated warnings, he ignored them until they arrived at the castle of Owein, where he foolishly engaged in an enchanted game played in a court surrounded by severed heads. In a bid to win the game, he approached a maiden in the court, who was promptly protected by a fierce knight. Gereint fought and defeated the knight, ending the violent games for good. After this encounter, Gereint reconciled with Enid and their relationship improved."
