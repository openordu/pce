    "text": "Gwynn ap Nudd was a Welsh hero, also known as Gwyn ap Nudd, Herne, Herne the Hunter, and Gabriel. He was the king of Fairyland and was referred to as the \"White One, son of the Dark.\" His dwelling place was believed to be under the Glastonbury Tor, the most significant feature in southwestern England. He ruled over the Tylwyth Teg, a group of tiny and beautiful people who wore blue and danced throughout the night similar to Irish Fairies. His favorite celebration was Beltane, the start of spring, during which he led the Wild Hunt to terrorize the living. He was named Gwynn, son of Nudd, and his father was the king of Annwn, an Otherworld similar to Hades. Gwynn could appear at any moment, accompanied by his enchanting host who played Fairy Music. His queen was Creiddylad, daughter of Lludd, who was the basis for Shakespeare's Cordelia in King Lear. Alternative names used for Gwyn ap Nudd included Herne the Hunter, a frightening figure who roamed Windsor Forest in England, and Gabriel, famous for his ferocious fairy hounds."
