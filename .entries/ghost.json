    "text": "The ghost is a popular figure in folkloric tales. Within the Celtic psyche, the world of the dead and the Otherworld are closely connected, making it difficult to distinguish between ghosts and the Fairies, which are diminished divinities. Both groups are said to frequent magical areas of the landscape such as bogs, lakes and islands. In fact, ghosts and Fairies have similar lifestyles, and both entities have the power to take away humans to the Otherworld. Not all people become ghosts; rather, it is only those who have been interrupted in the normal course of their lives, like a young mother who died in childbirth, and who worry about the safety of their children may become ghosts. The souls of such individuals may come back to haunt their house and family. Elders who die after leading full lives may also return as ghosts. These ghosts are content to capture the activities of their long-settled lives, such as sitting beside the fire with a pipe, bound by habit rather than an intention to affect the lives of the living. Those who died violent deaths can also be seen haunting the location of their demise. For example, in a small town in West Mayo, a headless ghost made an appearance. Such ghosts can be dispersed with holy water and blessed candles. Ghosts can appear alone or in large groups, such as the entire crew of a ship that went down at sea, who appeared just before another storm to warn their erstwhile fellows. Although gentle ghosts do exist, typically, ghosts try to convince the living to join them in the grave."
