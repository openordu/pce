    "text": "Sithchenn, an Irish hero, was both a Druid and a Smith. He was commissioned to make a prophecy for Niall of the Nine Hostages and his siblings. Sithchenn, peculiarly, set fire to his forge and observed which items the young boys would take as they escaped the burning building. Even though Niall rescued the anvil, which was the most important tool of the smith, Sithchenn prophesized that Niall would rise to lead all of Ireland from the royal seat of Tara."
