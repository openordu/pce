    "text": "Imbas Forosnai, also known as Imbus Forosna or Himbas Forosnai, was a divination system utilized by Irish Druids to reveal the location of hidden or stolen objects or to unravel secrets not meant for public knowledge. The second phase of the ritual, referred to as \"illumination between the hands,\" involved the Bard or seer consuming raw meat that was subsequently offered to the powers of the Otherworld. The seer was supposed to receive the answer to the query by the next day, but if that did not occur, the second phase was initiated. This included the seer uttering incantations into their hands, sleeping with their palms on their cheeks, and dreaming the answer to the questions posed."
