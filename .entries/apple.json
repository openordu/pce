    "text": "Symbolic fruit, the apple, holds great mystical power for the Celts and has appeared in numerous myths and legends. Its enchantment can be found hidden within the very word for Avalon, the Otherworld in Arthurian lore, as well as in tales of heroic figures such as Connla of the Golden Hair, who was fed apples by his Fairy Lover. The soul of king C\u00fa Ro\u00ed was said to have rested in an apple hidden inside the stomach of a Salmon, while it was also one of the sought-after goals of the Sons Of Tuireann. In British folklore, an apple tree blooming out of season was believed to foretell death. Symbolizing harmony, immortality, abundance and love, the apple was seen as a talisman of good fortune and prosperity, with some even suggesting a linguistic connection to Apollo, whose name, Apellon, may have derived from the same source as our modern-day word \"apple\"."
