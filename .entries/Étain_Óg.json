    "text": "A king named Cormac was married to \u00c9tain \u00d3g, daughter of another \u00c9tain, and bore a daughter whom \u00c9tain \u00d3g desired to have as her own. Because Cormac had a previous child, \u00c9tain \u00d3g arranged for her husband's baby daughter to be killed. However, the warriors appointed for the task fell in love with the child and abandoned her in a cowshed with hopes that she would be saved. The cowherd who found her adopted her and she was then named Mess Buachalla. It should be noted that in some versions of the story, Mess Buachalla is the daughter of \u00c9sa rather than \u00c9tain \u00d3g."
