During the Cattle Raid known as the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge, Orl\u00e1m was one of the first to fall at the hands of the great hero C\u00fachulainn. Following Orl\u00e1m's death, his charioteer brought his master's head to Medb and Ailill, but was met with a brutal end when C\u00fachulainn threw a stone at him."
