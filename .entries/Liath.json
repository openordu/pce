    "text": "In Irish mythology, there exist multiple individuals bearing the name Liath who have attained heroic status. One of these individuals hailed from the Nemedian race, who was responsible for clearing all the trees from the hill of Tara in order to cultivate corn. As a result of his contributions, the hill was named Druin L\u00e9ith to honor him. Another individual with the same name had feelings for a woman named Br\u00ed, however, their desire to wed was thwarted by their untimely deaths. Despite this, their legacy lives on through the joint name of Br\u00ed L\u00e9ith, which was given to one of the prominent Fairy Mounds situated in Ireland."
