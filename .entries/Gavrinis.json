    "text": "An island located in a small harbor off the coast of Morbihan in southern Brittany, Gavrinis (Gavr\u2019inis) is a Breton mythological site that features the fabulously engraved ritual chamber. This site is linked to Britain\u2019s Stonehenge by its megalithic rock architecture and by its Spiral iconography, which includes deeply incised carvings that decorate more than twenty enormous granite uprights, it is connected to Ireland\u2019s Br\u00fa Na B\u00f3inne, this network predating the Celts by far. Typically, astronomical points are found in such monuments, though it is unknown for what purpose they were intended. In the case of Gavrinis, this means that it may have been oriented towards the winter Solstice sunrise, which it is precisely aligned with. The Sun rising on that day, as it begins to rebirth towards summer, may have been thought to revive the bones placed within that have left traces. Just like other monuments of the Megalithic Civilization, Gavrinis was perhaps known by the local Celtic peoples and could have been a ritual site for them. These other Breton megalithic sites are often described in folklore as the place of Otherworld happenings, so it is possible that superstitious local lore protected such monuments long after their meaning was forgotten."
