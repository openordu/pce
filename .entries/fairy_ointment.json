    "text": "Fairy ointment is a motif commonly found in folklore. The ointment is said to be made in Fairyland and contains the oil of fourleafed clovers or Shamrocks. If applied to the eyes, the ointment allows the viewer to see things in their true form. Stories of midwives who were summoned to attend the birthing mothers in Fairyland often mention the use of fairy ointment. The midwives were instructed to apply the ointment to the newborn's eyes, but sometimes mistakenly rubbed their own eyes with the ointment. This resulted in them being able to see the truth of what was around them, such as a ruined shack instead of a palace, or a wizened old thing instead of a charming babe. The effects of fairy ointment were permanent and allowed the viewer to see through fairy Glamour or spells that typically obscure portals to Fairyland. The fairies themselves lost their invisibility and could be seen taking the essence from food, kidnapping brides, and causing mischief. The fairies did not take kindly to their loss of power and punished those who stole the fairy ointment harshly, even if it was taken unknowingly - they would blind the thief."
