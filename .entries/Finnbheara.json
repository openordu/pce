    "text": "Finnbheara, also known as Finvarra, Fin Varra, Fionvarra or Finbar, was an Irish hero who ruled all the fairies of the Connacht province or even all the fairies of Ireland from his Fairy Mound at Knockma near Tuam in Co. Galway. He was an exception to the usual belief that fairyland was ruled by a queen. Despite having a fairy wife, called \u00dana, Finnbheara was known for stealing beautiful women. He would lure them away with the soothing music of fairyland and then take them from this world. These women would forget their earthly lives and, in the bright beauty of Finnbheara\u2019s palace, dance and sing without sadness or sorrow. Sometimes, according to stories like that of Eithne the Fair, the woman\u2019s body remained behind in a coma-like state from which she could not be awakened. Other times, she simply vanished. Finnbheara is a symbol of the beautiful Otherworld and appears in several plays and poems of William Butler Yeats. Lady Gregory and Yeats collected tales of Finnbheara's exploits."
