    "text": "Irish mythology mentions Sin as a heroic woman, likely a leftover from a past goddess. The stories meant to recount her powers claim that she was capable of making wine from water and swine from leaves to nourish her army of warriors that she summoned with her magic. The tale of King Muircertach Mac Erc describes Sin's act of punishing the ruler for the murder of her kin when she was a young girl. She did this by seducing him and driving him insane."
