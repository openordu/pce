    "text": "A goddess named Albinal (Albu, Alba) was worshipped in ancient Britain. Pliny, the Roman author, mentioned her as the main goddess of Britain, who was also called Albion. Some other authors referred to her as Alba, but that name was also used for Scotland. Holinshed, who was a historian in early medieval Britain, mentioned a princess with the same name. This princess arrived on the British shore with fifty fugitive women who killed their husbands. In Irish mythology, a similar figure named Cesair landed with several men and boatloads of women. Albina's name may indicate a connection to the chalky soil of southeast Britain as it means \"white.\" However, some people have derived the word from an ancient term for \"height\" (as in \"Alps\")."
