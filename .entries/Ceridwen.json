    "text": "In the midst of Lake Bala (Llyn Tegid) in North Wales, dwelled Ceridwen, also known as Caridwen, Cerridwen, Cariadwen or Keridwen - a formidable goddess often referred to as a Witch or sorceress. She lived with her spouse Tegid Voel (\u201cthe bald\u201d), and their two children - the lovely Creirwy (\u201clight\u201d) and a little boy, Afagddu (\u201cdark\u201d), who happened to be the most unattractive child in the world. To make up for his appearance, Ceridwen wanted to transform her son into a great seer. She brewed an immensely potent mixture of herbs, which had to simmer in her Cauldron for a year and a day - a magical duration that was fitting for such a concoction. The concoction required frequent stirring, and so she commissioned a young boy named Gwion to stir the Cauldron, but warned him not to taste the brew. While stirring it, three tiny droplets spilled onto Gwion\u2019s thumb, and instinctively, he put in his mouth to ease the burn. At that precise moment, all the wisdom and inspiration that Ceridwen had designed for Afagddu went to Gwion instead. As soon as Ceridwen learnt of the boy's inadvertent theft, she became extremely angry, but with his new perception, Gwion had foreseen her reaction and fled. Ceridwen pursued him. Gwion transformed himself into a hare, but Ceridwen transformed into a greyhound to match him; he became a fish and she, an otter; he transformed into a bird, and she, a hawk. Eventually, Gwion turned into a grain of wheat, she changed into a hen, and she consumed him completely. In Celtic myths, food and drink are frequently used as symbolic forms of reproduction. Consuming an insect in a glass of water often leads to pregnancy for various heroines and goddesses. An example of this occurs in the tale of Ceridwen, who was impregnated by the transformed Gwion. Nine months later, she gave birth to a baby boy, whom she set adrift on the sea in anger but then touched by his reborn beauty. This child grew up to be the revered poet Taliesin. Although identified as a mother in this story, Ceridwen is described using language more commonly associated with the Cailleach or Hag goddess, showcasing her abilities as a magician or witch with impressive occult knowledge, such as Shape-Shifting. It is believed that she could have potentially been the original cosmic goddess of time and the seasons, given the names of her two children. Interpretations of Ceridwen and Gwion's many transformations suggest that the story may be a tale of initiation and rebirth. The cauldron, a vital symbol of Ceridwen, is also significant in other Celtic tales as a representation of abundance, as it is believed to be an Otherworldly vessel from which the fertility god Dagda distributes wealth and prosperity. Therefore, despite her fierce appearance, Ceridwen could have been a goddess of the land whose fertility provided an abundance of food."
