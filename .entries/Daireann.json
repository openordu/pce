    "text": "Daireann, also known as Doirend or Doirinn, is an Irish heroine, lesser-known than her sister, Sadb. She had a liking for the great warrior Fionn Mac Cumhaill, but he did not reciprocate her interest. To get back at him, she poisoned him with an enchanted elixir that made him go insane, rather than taking his life. Fionn's followers, the Fianna, left him during this period of madness, but they returned when he regained his senses. Daireann's pride suffered another blow when Fionn had a child with Sadb, who became his favorite follower, the poet Ois\u00edn. D\u00e1irine, an Irish princess, is the daughter of Tuathal Techtmar, a minor king. She caught the eye of the king of Leinster, Eochaid but he was compelled by Tuathal to marry her older sister Fithir instead. Eochaid, however, outwitted his father-in-law by claiming that Fithir had died, thus marrying D\u00e1irine instead. His marriage with her was not a happy one because D\u00e1irine stumbled upon the place where Fithir was being held captive and uncovered her husband's deceitful act."
