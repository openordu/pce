    "text": "For the Celts, their ancestors\u2019 spirits were always present and remained close to their families. These spirits were usually perceived as neutral or protective, but required regular attention in order to remain positive. There is a possibility that in early Celtic civilization, honoring ancestors may have been as important as the worship of goddesses and gods who were addressed as \u201cmothers\u201d and \u201cfathers\u201d of individual tribes. Later on, during Christian times, the veneration of a family\u2019s patron saint could have stemmed from this same practice. In France, especially in Brittany, it was a common practice to water graves with milk as though the dead needed its nourishment. In Ireland, on the day of Samhain when the veil between the earthly world and the Otherworld became thinnest, the dead came back to visit their loved ones. They could be found sitting in their usual chairs, where they would have a drink, smoke a pipe, and sit by the fire. People would often leave out food and tobacco for them. The underlying notion behind such rituals was that if the dead were not attended to, they could grow angry and cause disruptions in the earthly world."
