    "text": "Arthurian tales often feature a sorrowful incident known as the dolorous blow. In the stories regarding the Fisher King, this refers to the blow that was unintentionally dealt to his groin by his own brother Balin. This one act resulted in the land becoming infertile and devoid of life."
