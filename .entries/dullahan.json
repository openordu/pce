    "text": "Irish folklore tells of a figure known as the dullahan, also spelled d\u00falachan or dulachan. This entity is typically depicted as a headless horseman, who has been ascribed the role of Death Coach driver. In other accounts, the dullahan appears as a phantom astride a headless horse. The dullahan is considered a masculine and more obscure counterpart to the Banshee, a wailing fairy associated with death omens. Anyone who sees the dullahan riding by is said to receive news of an impending death. The unique fate of those who dare to behold him is the loss of their sight, inflicted by a flick of his whip."
