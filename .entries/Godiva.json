    "text": "Godiva, also known as Godgifu or Dame Goode Eve, was a heroine from Britain. In 1967, a commemoration was held in her honor by the town of Coventry, supposedly marking the 900th anniversary of her death. While her story is said to be based on historical events, it is difficult to distinguish the truth from the many Celtic mythological elements it incorporates. Medieval chronicles mention her and her husband, Leonfric, the Earl of Mercia, and commend her generosity while providing details of her famous ride. The story goes that when Leonfric imposed exorbitant taxes on the vassals leading to hunger and suffering, Godiva appealed for mercy, but her husband refused to budge. In a cruel twist, Leonfric challenged his wife that only if she rode naked through the streets of Coventry would he reduce the tax burden on his people. Godiva took up the challenge, but demanded that the windows of the town be covered with fabric to preserve her modesty. Clad only in her long hair, she then rode through the empty streets of the town. Only one person, Peeping Tom, defied her request and was subsequently struck blind by the sight of her glorious body. Coventry was located in the region that was once home to the Brigantes, an ancient Celtic tribe that worshipped the Horse goddess, either as Epona or under another name. The Brigantes revered Brigit, a goddess known in other contexts for her power to blind and restore sight. The story of Godiva bears resemblance to the tale of Gr\u00e1inne, an assertive heroine from Ireland, who too had appeared on horseback, clad only in her hair. Celtic culture is known to have practiced female nudity as a means to promote fertility of the land. This information is supported by various classical sources, one of them being the Roman writer, Pliny. The famous ride of Lady Godiva resulted in increased abundance for her people who were in a state of poverty. The story of Lady Godiva serves to obscure and at the same time, maintain the image of a once-worshipped goddess who acted as a protector."
