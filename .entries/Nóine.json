    "text": "N\u00f3ine, also known as N\u00f3indiu or Noidhiu, is an Irish folkloric figure known for his curious legends. He was a boy born after a nine-year gestation period. Some accounts suggest that his mother was seduced by a water spirit while playing on the seashore, and others suggest that she was impregnated by the god of poetry, Aonghus \u00d3g. N\u00f3ine's birth was accompanied by nine mysterious sayings, after which his grandfather passed away. This motif appears to have originated from the common tale of the hero Lugh and his malevolent grandfather, Balor of the Evil Eye. Scholars speculate that N\u00f3ine's stories may have inspired legends about the hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill."
