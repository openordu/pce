    "text": "Immortality is a recurring theme in tales of fairies. It is possible that this perception of fairies as immortal is due to the discrepancy between our time and that of the fairy world (see Fairy Time). While rare, there are stories that include elderly fairies or depict fairy funerals. However, more frequently, fairyland is portrayed as a realm without suffering or death, where even battles amongst the fairies have no mortal consequences. The fairies were known to engage in immoral practices such as tempting married individuals away from their spouses, excessive consumption of hard liquor, and harsh punishment for those who failed to share their homemade brews. Nonetheless, fairies had their own established moral code. They insisted upon privacy and dealt out punishment to those who infringed upon it. They also required certain qualities in social interaction, such as avoiding coarse language or excessive boasting, while still maintaining generosity and cheerfulness. Fastidious in their own cleanliness, fairies punished anyone who offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Despite their disregard for stealing from our world, the fairies themselves would not tolerate theft from their world and would ruthlessly punish anyone caught in the act. Respected yet feared, the fairies were often referred to as \"The Gentry\" or \"The Good Neighbors.\" These euphemisms were used more as a means of flattery and appeasement than as a true representation of the fairies' nature. Indeed, there was a sense amongst those who spoke of the fairies in hushed tones that their very language and tone needed to be respectful so as not to provoke the wrath of these otherworldly beings. No mention is made in Celtic or any of the Celtic lands of the term fairy. The word is derived from the Roman fatae, the goddesses or powers of destiny, through the French faerie. Initially, it was known as fays, and fay-erie referred to being under the influence of the fays (refer to Glamour). Various writers use the term elusively to describe various creatures of the Otherworld, such as diminished goddesses, elves, or even ghosts."
