    "text": "Eochaid Airem was the husband of \u00c9tain, the queen of Tara, who is the subject of Ireland\u2019s most beautiful love story. Eochaid wished to become the king of Tara and, after proving his worthiness through successful combats, he scheduled his Inauguration. However, the people of Ireland refused to acknowledge him as king without a queen to represent the Sovereignty of the land. Eochaid then embarked on a journey to find the most beautiful woman in Ireland and found her in \u00c9tain who, unbeknownst to her, was the reincarnated lover of the Fairy king Midir. \u00c9tain had forgotten her identity due to being cursed by a jealous rival in previous incarnations. She willingly went to Tara to become Eochaid\u2019s wife, but Midir had not forgotten about her. Midir proposed a wager to Eochaid and won \u00c9tain back, taking her to his great palace under the hill at Br\u00ed L\u00e9ith. Before leaving Tara, \u00c9tain was pregnant and gave birth to a daughter whom Eochaid unknowingly married (see \u00c9sa). From this incestuous union, their daughter, Mess Bua Challa, became the mother of king Conaire. Some have argued that incest motifs, such as those present in this myth, may hide myths of origin, as incest would have been necessary in the beginning of time to populate the world. Thus, this complex myth may describe a time of world creation."
