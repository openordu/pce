    "text": "A goddess of British origin, Coventina, is well-known mostly thanks to sculptures discovered at a sacred well located in Northumberland. These sculptures depict her as a woman reclining and pouring water out of an urn. Alternatively, she is also depicted as a woman surrounded by plants and pouring water from her vessel onto them. Although her influence was primarily restricted to the Carrawburgh River in Britain, she has been discovered in other countries such as France and Spain where she was revered with various titles including Augusta and Sancta, meaning \u201chigh\u201d and \u201choly\u201d respectively, pointing to her high status. As with other water goddesses belonging to the Celtic culture, Coventina might have also had a special ability to heal."
