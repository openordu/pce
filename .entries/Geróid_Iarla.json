    "text": "Ger\u00f3id Iarla or Gerald, Earl of Desmond, was a beloved figure in Irish folklore. Maurice, the Earl of Desmond in southwestern Munster, first saw and fell deeply in love with the stunning fairy queen \u00c1ine, who was noticed swimming in the form of a swan near the mouth of the River Com\u00f3g, that flowed into the enchanting Lough Gur. Maurice then stole her cloak, which was the only way to claim the Swan Maiden. Thereupon, \u00c1ine came to live with him, and they had a child together - the next earl, Ger\u00f3id. However, maintaining a relationship with a Fairy Bride meant following specific prohibitions and taboos. For example, \u00c1ine required that Maurice never show surprise at anything their son did, but the earl disregarded this rule when Ger\u00f3id startled him by jumping into a bottle and out again during a banquet. Consequently, the boy and his mother disappeared into the Lake, or Ger\u00f3id transformed himself into a goose that swam nearby. However, every seven years on a moonlit night, Ger\u00f3id rides forth on a white horse from Lough Gur."
