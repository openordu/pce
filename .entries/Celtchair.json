    "text": "An Irish hero named Celtchair is the subject of this tale. The Celts believed in the importance of the laws of Hospitality, which Celtchair neglected. During a Fidchell game, one in which his king Concobar Mac Nessa played against hero C\u00fachulainn, Celtchair spilled blood on the game board. To restore his reputation, he was given three impossible tasks. Although he was successful in completing two of these tasks, Celtchair perished when he killed a spectral Dog, an evil creature that had terrorized the land for some time. The blood of the Dog was poisonous and ultimately fatal to Celtchair, but he died having saved his honor."
