    "text": "The mythological site of Callanish (Callernish) is found on the isle of Lewis and Harris, which is part of the Outer Hebrides located off Scotland. Callanish is a noteworthy Stone Circle and is widely acclaimed. According to local tradition, the stones at this site, along with other stone circles, were initially Giants who turned to stone as a result of their refusal to convert to Christianity. These monuments, constructed by the Megalithic Civilization 4,000 years before Celtic people arrived, were most likely converted by the latter for their own ritualistic purposes. Every 18 years, the full moon from Callanish appears to rise from the feet of a hill-shaped like a woman and crosses over her body until it disappears behind her head."
