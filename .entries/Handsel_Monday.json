    "text": "Scottish tradition holds a festival called Hansel Monday (Di-luian an t-sainnseil). This event takes place on the first Monday following Hogmany (New Year\u2019s Day) and involves fortune-telling through games of chance and trial. On the Isle of Skye, the weather of this day is believed to predict that of the following 12 months, marking the first of a 12-day sequence. The holiday is derived from the Scottish sainnseal, or gift given to every visitor on this occasion. The name has anglicized over time."
