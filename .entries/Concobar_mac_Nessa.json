    "text": "Irish tales of the Ulster Cycle feature Concobar mac Nessa, a renowned king of Ulster who earns his name as a matronymic from his mother Nessa. Nessa transforms into a fierce warrior following her rape by the druid Cathbad, who may be Concobar\u2019s father, though some accounts attribute his paternity to Ulster king Fachtna Fathach instead. Unconventional means may have led to Nessa\u2019s pregnancy, as a magical worm in a drink may have played a role in her conception. Fergus Mac R\u00f3ich, another great king, falls in love with Nessa after her husband passes away. He willingly gives up his own throne to allow Nessa\u2019s children the opportunity to claim royal lineage. But when Fergus tires of waiting to reclaim his royal title, Nessa challenges his request, causing him to seek out Queen Medb of Connacht. Medb, who is Concobar\u2019s former wife, subsequently launches an attack on Concobar\u2019s territory, in a conflict known as T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge. When Ulster begins to experience debilitative pains due to a curse inflicted upon its warriors by the dying goddess MacHA, Concobar - like the others - is affected as well. It\u2019s possible that he himself may have been responsible for the curse as he once demanded that the pregnant goddess race against his fastest horses. Although Fergus almost kills Concobar as a consequence of Medb\u2019s raid, the Ulster king survives until he is struck down by a calcified brain ball. Concobar's marital life was certainly not lacking in complexity - apart from being wedded to Medb, he also had three sisters-in-law as wives: Eithne Aittench\u00e1ithrech, Clothra, and Mugain. His offspring were prominent in Irish folklore but he also had a wandering eye which landed on Deirdre, who he tried to coerce into becoming his concubine. She, however, fled with her lover. The tale ends on a sombre note, painting Concobar as a vengeful schemer, far from the ideal Celtic king (see Kingship)."
