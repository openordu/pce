    "text": "In ancient Irish, the concept of tuath was more than just a simple group of people - it extended to the land that the group inhabited. Each tuath chose a king, resulting in numerous kings in Irish mythology and history, because there were roughly 150 tuaths in Ireland. Scholars suggest that a tuath usually had around 3,000 members, implying that the island had a total population of half a million individuals. A similar term existed in continental Celtic languages and gave rise to the name of a tribal god named Teutates. According to an ancient legal text, it was necessary for a tuath to have not only a king, but also other positions such as a bard, churchman, and scholar. The tuath's king was paid taxes, primarily in food, and could enlist able-bodied men to protect the territory and its inhabitants. Most individuals spent their entire lives within the physical area of their tuath, encountering their friends, relations, and even enemies at regular assemblies and festivals known as \u00d3enach. While most rights were confined to the territory of the tuath, the bard or poet had the freedom to travel beyond those boundaries and expect to be treated with respect."
