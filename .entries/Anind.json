    "text": "Early invader Nemed had a son, Anind, who is recognized as an Irish hero. Anind is associated with the emergence of a significant feature of the Irish landscape - Lough Ennell in Co. Westmeath. Prior to the digging of Anind's grave, that area of Ireland had no visible surface water. However, as soon as the grave was dug, the lake overflowed. This type of story regarding the formation of landscapes frequently points to the existence of an ancient deity with the ability to create."
