    "text": "A Welsh hero by the name of Elidyr is famous for his story of visiting Fairyland, as recorded by the 12th-century Welsh geographer and historian, Giraldus Cambrensis. As a child, Elidyr was taken to the Otherworld by two little men where everything was beautiful - the land was bountiful, the people were beautiful, and the weather was always sunny. After spending a few hours in the Otherworld, Elidyr realized he needed to return home as his mother would be worried over his absence. When he arrived back home, he told his mother of the lovely land he had visited, and she sent him back to retrieve something useful. So Elidyr went back into the hole on the riverbank through which he had descended before, only to find that the Otherworld was as he had remembered it. He managed to retrieve a little gold ball, thinking that no one would notice it missing. Unfortunately, it is impossible to steal from the Fairies, so the fairies caught Elidyr as he was leaving and were angry and disappointed at his actions. They did not punish him, but they did allow him to go back to the surface world, free and safe. However, no matter how hard he searched, Elidyr could never find the riverbank entrance to Fairyland again."
