    "text": "Christianity, specifically the veneration of Mary (Saint Mary), has connections to Celtic culture. During the time of the Roman Empire's presence in Celtic territories, the Interpretatio Romana was practiced. This involved renaming local deities with Roman names while still preserving their original legends and iconography. Similarly, the Roman Catholic Church assimilated many indigenous European religions into its own by adopting and adapting their spiritual beliefs. The mother of Jesus, the virgin Mary, proved to be a valuable figure in this endeavor as she integrated the symbols and stories of various Celtic and other European Mother Goddesses. According to English folklore, the entirety of the island was provided as a bridal dowry for Mary by her brother, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a merchant and also the Grail's bearer in Britain after the death of Mary's son, Jesus. Legend has it that Mary herself spent her remaining years in Britain following the resurrection."
