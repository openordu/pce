    "text": "A notorious member of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann was Aill\u00e9n mac Midgna (or Midna, or Midhna), also known as \"the burner.\" Aill\u00e9n was a musician whose music had such a hypnotic effect that the defenders of Tara, whose great halls were burned down by Aill\u00e9n for 23 years in a row, fell asleep and could not resist. Aill\u00e9n retreated to his Fairy Mound at Finnachaid each year, leaving Tara to be rebuilt. However, after years of destruction, the hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill killed Aill\u00e9n with a poisoned spear that caused insomnia to anyone who breathed its fumes, including those who had been lulled by Aill\u00e9n's music. Finnachaid was said to be the home not only of Aill\u00e9n, but also of the tragic King Lir."
