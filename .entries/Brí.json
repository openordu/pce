    "text": "Irish mythology recounts the tale of Br\u00ed, a heroine whose name was incorporated into the title of the influential Fairy Mound of Br\u00ed L\u00e9ith. She lived in the S\u00eddhe, her father Midir's palace, and was adored by a warrior named Liath. The precise cause and manner of the deaths of both Br\u00ed and Liath during her trip to see him in Tara remains unclear. Despite never having been joined in life, the two lovers' names were happily entwined with the naming of Midir's splendid abode."
