    "text": "Maxen (known also as Macsen or Macsen Wledig) is a renowned figure in Welsh history. Initially a Spanish Roman soldier, Maxen's Celtic background is not entirely clear. He relocated to Britain around 383 AD and wed a woman called Elen, also known as Helen Lwddog. Maxen was an exceptional warrior and general, leading his legions in a rebellion against Rome. He was declared the Emperor Magnus Maximus of Rome by his troops, and they went on to conquer the continental Roman territories before taking Rome itself. However, upon encountering Theodosius, the emperor of the eastern region of Rome, Maxen suffered a defeat and was subsequently executed on July 28, 388 AD. Maxen's wife Elen was allowed to return to Wales, where she was the matriarch of various dynasties. Maxen has been mentioned in Welsh literature, most notably in the poetic work \"The Dream of Maxen\"."
