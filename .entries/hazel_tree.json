    "text": "The hazel tree was considered a sacred Celtic tree and held in great reverence by the Celts. It was believed that when hazel trees grew at the sources of major rivers, they produced nuts of Wisdom. The nuts, when eaten by fish, especially salmon, speckled their flesh, with one spot appearing for each nut consumed. The fish that had the most speckles brought the most wisdom to the eater. Magical hazel groves that fed the fish swam at the source of both the Boyne and the Shannon rivers. Uneaten nuts of the hazel trees turned into bubbles of inspiration that were readily seen at the Shannon's source, which was fed from underground springs that created a pool in Co. Cavan.  Reportedly, Hazel trees shaded Connla's Well located in Co. Tipperary; anyone who ate their nuts would become a brilliant bard and scholar. The Celts associated the hazelnuts with wisdom, which was reflected in their mythology that required bards to carve their staffs from hazel wood and in the taboo against burning the wood of hazel trees. Even today, it is believed that hazel twigs guide water-witches to underground streams. The unrelated witch-hazel tree found in America is also considered to have the same power. Fairies were believed to inhabit hazel trees, similar to the thorn, another traditional tree. In Ireland, Tara was described as a hazel grove, while in Scotland, Carlton (from the ancient Celtic word Calltuinn) referred to an area where a sacred hazel grove once flourished."
