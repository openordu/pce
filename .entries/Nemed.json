    "text": "An Irish god known as Nemed (Neimheadh) is described in the Book Of Invasions, a text that contains the mythological history of Ireland. Nemed was one of the early settlers on the island and traced his ancestry back to the biblical Noah through his son Japheth. Furthermore, it was noted that he had a connection to the monster god of Britain named Magog. After leaving his homeland of Scythia, Nemed arrived on the island thirty years after the mysterious people of Parthol\u00f3n were wiped out by an unknown plague but while malevolent beings called the Fomorians were still causing chaos. Nemed sailed toward Ireland with an armada of ships. However, his seamen tried to land when they saw a tower of Gold on a shore, hoping to make themselves rich. Unfortunately, the sea was against them, and all the boats except the one carrying Nemed and his wife Macha were destroyed. Despite this setback, Nemed continued his journey, and after 18 months, they finally reached landfall. Nemed's people had to fight against the fierce Fomorians to win the right to settle, and eventually, they were able to defeat this monstrous race. Then, Nemed set his people to work building his palace, Rath Chinneich in Armagh, but after its completion, he massacred the workers to ensure they could never build a palace better than his. Nemed also cleared the first fields in the dense forests of ancient Ireland in honor of his wife Macha, who was the first of three goddesses or heroines by that name. However, Nemed and his descendants, the Nemedians, did not remain in Ireland for a long time. After Nemed passed away, the Fomorians took revenge for his attack on their people by enslaving the Nemedians. When the Nemedians attempted to flee, the Fomorians utilized the elements of wind and sea to quash the rebellion, causing all but one of the Nemedian ships to capsize into the ocean. That single surviving ship carried Fergus Lethderg, Nemed's son, and Macha, who sailed to the next island to the east. There, Fergus, along with his son Brit\u00e1n, established himself as the forefather of the British people. Some believe that Brit\u00e1n lent his name to the island, while others assert that the goddess Britannia did so. Semeon, another descendant, journeyed all the way to Greece and became the forefather of the Fir Bolg. The Fir Bolg returned to Ireland to battle the Fomorians anew. Other Nemedian descendants traveled farther north, becoming the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, returning to Ireland to emerge victorious in battles against both the Fir Bolg and the Fomorians during the two battles of Mag Tuired. The name of this god or hero, related to the Celtic word Nemeton, meaning \"sacred place\" or \"grove,\" has been interpreted to signify a \"sacred person\" or even a Druid. Hidden within the complicated anecdotes of the Book of Invasions appear to be certain historical facts. The Nemedians appeared to be a Celtic people who had lived on Ireland for some time before relocating to Britain, where they maintained their powerful status until the arrival of the Germanic tribes known as the Angles and Saxons. Endeavors to interpret the Book of Invasions through the lens of factual settlement patterns always result in speculation."
