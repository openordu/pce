    "text": "Symbolic in nature, the thorn tree (Prunus and Crageaeus species) is recognized as one of the most commanding and mystifying plants in Celtic territories. Blooming during the celebration of Beltane on May 1st, the blackthorn (Prunus) is adorned with sweet white flowers alongside sharp, pin-like thorns capable of piercing the skin. Although its thorns render it largely unhelpful, except as a Cattle hedge, its magical properties are impressive, as it affords protection to humans against the Fairy people. Numerous precautions were taken to ensure this tree retained its power, most notably avoiding pruning it on May 11th or November 11th, as the trees would seek retribution against the woodcutter. Similarly, the whitethorn was also recognized as a protective plant, yet its wood had to be kept outdoors since fairies were hyperaware of its presence indoors, causing it to haunt the house where it was kept. Hawthorns also burst into bloom every spring, clad in extravagant pink blossoms. Bathing in the dew from hawthorn blossoms on Beltane was a guarantee of eternal beauty. Cutting this tree resulted in anger and woodcutters occasionally bore witness to frightening animals emerging from a wounded hawthorn, chasing or wounding them. Those who dug up thorns were especially likely to incur Fairy Stroke, the paralysis one experiences when a fairy touches their skin, no matter how gently. The occurrence of a thorn grouped together with an Ash and Oak tree was a certain indication of fairy activity in the area without fail."
