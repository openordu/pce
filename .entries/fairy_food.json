    "text": "Fairy food is a folkloric motif that describes food that is tastier than anything found on earth. Fairies, however, prefer our grosser fare and sneak into our world to steal it. Butter is one of their favorites, as it contains an essence called Foyson. Although fairy food is delicious, it offers little nourishment. Irish folklore describes many charms used to preserve butter, such as putting mullein leaves or holy water in the churn. The fairies also love fresh-baked bread and will steal it away if left unattended. However, sometimes the fairies provide food from their own larders to help their human neighbors in times of need. Tales from Ireland's Great Hunger of the 1840s and other hard times tell of food such as marvelous sweets being found in abandoned fields, saving families from starvation. Although such food was thought to be cursed and should be avoided, it was sometimes the only option during times of severe hunger. The fairies were known for their exceptional baking skills and made fairy cakes using oatmeal and barley. Many stories suggest that fairy food, although delightful to the senses, is really only twigs and pebbles with a Glamour or spell cast upon them. It is crucial never to eat while visiting Fairyland, as consuming fairy food makes it nearly impossible to return to earthly life."
