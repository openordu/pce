    "text": "Hooded spirits known as genius cucullatus (pl., genii cucullati) were revered as gods in the Continental and British Celtic culture. Often depicted as a group of small phalluses, the spirits were named after the hood (in Latin, cucullus) attached to their cloaks which were found across the Celtic lands. While they appeared singularly in the former, in Britain, the cucullati always appeared as triplets. The exact function and significance of these hooded spirits is not established, but their form suggests that they were associated with Fertility. Some sculptures reveal that their hoods were removed, revealing not the head of a human but that of a phallus. In Britain, the genii cucullati were portrayed as Dwarfs holding Eggs, which emphasized their connection to fertility. These sculptures were distributed in the exact pattern as the mother goddesses known as Deae Matres who frequently accompany them, sometimes with the goddess named Cuda."
