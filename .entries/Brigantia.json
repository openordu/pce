    "text": "The deity Brigantia, a Continental Celtic and British goddess, was venerated by the Brigantes, a Brythonic Celtic people, in the northern sections of the island now known as the northern six counties of the present-day nation. The rivers Braint in Anglesey and Brent in Middlesex bear her name as a testament to her significance. During the Roman era, Brigantia was commonly linked with Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory, and Caelestis, a sky goddess from Syria. Her name, which means \u201chigh one,\u201d might imply a connection to the Irish goddess Brigit. Brigantia has also been related to Brigindo, the Gallic goddess. Not known as a river goddess in Ireland, Brigit\u2019s association with holy wells suggests that the Celts identified her as a water deity linked to fertility."
