    "text": "The theme of the Debility of the Ulstermen, also known as N\u00f3inden Ulad or Ceisnoidhe Uladh, is a prevalent myth in Irish mythology. The reason behind the curse was the mistreatment of a man's wife. The goddess Macha, who was pregnant at the time, warned her mortal husband, Crunniuc, not to speak of her when he went to the Assembly of Ulster, against her will. Despite the warning, Crunniuc boasted about her speed, which led to a race being proposed. Although Macha begged not to be forced to run due to her condition, the race went ahead as the king hoped that her size would slow her down. Despite being heavily pregnant, Macha proved to be powerful and swift and completed the race before the king's horses were even halfway. However, the exertion caused her to give birth to twins and die during labor. Macha, while dying, placed a Curse on the Ulstermen who caused her death. The curse stated that every time the Ulstermen were attacked, they would fall to the ground for four days and five nights in labor-like agony, for nine times nine generations. This curse played a significant part in the Irish epic T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge. The hero of the epic, C\u00fachulainn, was not susceptible to the curse as he was not born in Ulster. Therefore, he had to hold off the entire army of Connacht while the Ulstermen suffered from their debility."
