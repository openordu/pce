    "text": "The glastyn, or glashtin, is a figure of Manx folklore. This spectral Water Horse could be found on the Isle of Man and appeared as an attractive man with curly hair. However, upon closer inspection, one would notice that his ears looked quite similar to those of a horse. Despite his handsome appearance, the glastyn was not to be trusted as he would sneak into the homes of young women while their families were away and drag them to their demise in the sea."
