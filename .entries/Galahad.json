    "text": "Galahad, also known as Gwalchafed, was a hero in Arthurian legends. He held a high rank among the Round Table's knights and was Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic's illegitimate son. Galahad was renowned for his impeccable qualities and was deemed as King Arthur's perfect representative, being the most virtuous, loyal, and chaste knight among them. In several Arthurian tales, he was portrayed as a foil to the flawed Lancelot and human Arthur by being saintly and perfect. Galahad discovered the mystical Grail in many of these stories, and after that, he disappeared without a trace, as his pure soul touched the mighty chalice and sent him to heaven. While Galahad's name may have Celtic origins, indicating a warrior falcon, and despite his Fairy lineage as the foster son of the Lady of the Lake and Elaine's son, scholars believe he is a post-Christian concept merged with the legend's pagan rootstock, and there is no genuine Celtic counterpart for this pure figure."
