    "text": "A Welsh hero known as Pwyll, or Pwyll Prince of Dyfed and Pwyll Pendefig Dyfed stars in the Mabinogion, the collection of Welsh mythological narratives. In the first branch of the series, Pwyll was asked by Arawn, an Otherworldly king, to swap places with him since he was being persecuted by a rival Hafgan, with a hope that Pwyll might save his kingdom. Pwyll agreed and took on Arawn's appearance, ruling efficiently in the Otherworld. His high level of integrity made him decline making love with Arawn's queen, despite her not realizing that her husband's form had a different man's soul in it. At the end of the year, Pwyll defeated Hafgan in single combat and fostered a deeper connection with the grateful king Arawn. Upon returning to his world, Pwyll fell madly in love with a gorgeous woman whom no one could catch, and who always appeared on a white Horse. He pursued Rhiannon for several nights, but couldn't catch her until he called after her to stop. They got married soon after, but their contentment was short-lived. When Rhiannon had blood on her face and the child was missing, Pwyll thought she had eaten their child, hence punishing her by making her act as a horse to carry visitors to their castle. She served for many years before Pyrderi, their son who had been kidnapped by a spectral arm then rescued by a distant farmer, returned to relieve her of her burden. Without mentioning herself or introducing the topic, Nora Chadwick's writing style emulates a helpful scholar, as evidenced by the sentence \"Pwyll's reign thereafter was without disturbance and abundantly successful.\""
