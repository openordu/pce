    "text": "A Celtic heroine named Scota appears in Irish legend. It is unclear who exactly she is, but one story from the Book of Invasions claims that she was the daughter of the pharaoh Cingris. Another version claims that a woman with the same name was the daughter of pharaoh Nechtanebus and wife to the Irish invader M\u00edl, who represented a Celtic tribal ancestor known as the Milesians. Some suggest that Scota may have been an ancestor goddess for the ancient Irish people, as they were once referred to as \"scoti\" or \"scots\", a name which later became associated with Scotland, another Celtic homeland."
