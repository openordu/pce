    "text": "Irish heroine Aid\u00edn (also known as Aideen) is a figure in Irish lore who was married to Oscar, a warrior belonging to the elite Fianna clan. Although considered a minor character, Aid\u00edn's story involves her heartbreaking death caused by her husband's passing. Following her death, the Bard Ois\u00edn gave her a burial of high honors and laid her to rest beneath a Cairn on the hill known as Benn \u00c9tair."
