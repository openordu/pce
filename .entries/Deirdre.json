    "text": "The protagonist of this story is a female Irish hero called \u201cDeirdre of the Sorrows,\u201d whose tragic life is fittingly expressed through her title. This tale, along with the stories of the Children Of Lir, and of the Sons Of Tuireann, is regarded as one of the Three Sorrows of Ireland. The opening scene takes place during a feast hosted by Deirdre\u2019s father, the poet and storyteller Fedlimid mac Daill, in honor of King Concobar Mac Nessa\u2019s attendance. Interestingly, the birth of Deirdre coincides with the feast. Cathbad, a druid present at the ceremony, prophesies that the girl will grow up to be the most beautiful woman and will be responsible for the downfall of the kingdom. Most of the Ulstermen are alarmed by the prophecy and demand that the infant be killed out of fear for the kingdom's safety, but King Concobar, who is lustful for Deirdre, refuses. Concobar's decision is to rear the infant as his private treasure. Deirdre is entrusted to Leborcham, a wise woman occasionally referred to as a wise man, while Concobar returns to his palace at Emain Macha. The king turns his attention to other affairs, confident that when Deirdre reaches womanhood, he will claim her as his own. Nevertheless, this is not to be, as Deirdre witnesses a Raven drinking the blood of a calf spilled on snow. She whispered her desire for a man with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as a raven's feather to Leborcham. Upon hearing this, Leborcham instinctively knew who the lucky man would be, none other than Concobar's nephew No\u00edsiu, the son of the mighty warrior Uisneach. However, despite her promise to the king, Leborcham arranged for the two young individuals to meet. Their connection was instant, and they fell hopelessly in love. Soon, they both fled, accompanied by No\u00edsiu's brothers Ard\u00e1n and Ainnle, unable to bear the thought of being apart. While Concobar pursued the young lovers across Ireland, they successfully escaped to a remote area in Scotland near Loch Etive, where they lived together. Eventually, they may have had children, as in some texts a son named Gaiar and a daughter named A\u00edbg\u00e9ne are mentioned. Alas, their happiness was short-lived, as the attention of the Scottish king was drawn to Deirdre's beauty, and he demanded that she marry him. Once again, Deirdre and the sons of Uisneach fled, this time to a secluded island in the hopes of finding peace. Meanwhile, back in Ulster, Concobar was still grieving over the loss of his beloved prize. He lured the couple back to Ireland by deceitfully claiming he had lost interest in Deirdre. The homesick No\u00edsiu agreed to return, and despite Deirdre's premonitions of doom, she reluctantly agreed to go with the three brothers. When they arrived in Ireland, however, the warriors of Concobar immediately attacked No\u00edsiu and his brothers, leaving them unable to defend themselves, and killing them under a blood-red sky. Deirdre was brought back to Conobar's court in chains and bitterly reproached the king for his deceit and violence. Although Concobar gained possession of Deirdre, he eventually decided that he no longer wanted her. To further humiliate her, the king gave her away to one of the men who had killed her lover. As the murderer carried her away in his chariot, Deirdre jumped from it and died when her head smashed against a stone. Due to his lustful and deceitful behaviour, many prominent warriors of Ulster became disillusioned with Concobar and deserted his kingdom to serve under queen Medb of Connacht. Subsequently, Medb launched a war against Concobar that serves as the main storyline for the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge - the most significant Irish epic."
