    "text": "Mab, also known as Mabb, is a folkloric figure from Wales. Similar to the goddess Medb in Ireland, who was reduced to a historical queen, Mab is also a Fairy Queen that offers a faint trace of her earlier divine identity. In Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, Mab is referred to as the \"fairies' midwife,\" a role that was traditionally played by a human victim of Fairy Kidnapping. According to Shakespeare, Mab's other responsibility was to bring nightmares, which is a common trait among mischievous fairies, even though it is not often attributed to Medb. Scholars have suggested that her playful name could have been derived from the Welsh term for a child, mab, which also appears in the Welsh myths known as the Mabinogion. Shakespeare used British and Welsh fairy tales freely, and although his depictions of mythical creatures are colorful, they may not always be accurate."
