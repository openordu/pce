    "text": "Both the continental and insular Celts were known to have practiced human sacrifice according to Roman sources. Julius Caesar had described a specific ritual where victims along with many animals were enclosed in an enormous human-shaped wicker structure and burned alive. Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and Tacitus had confirmed that human sacrifice was performed by the Celts as an offering for their gods. Tacitus had claimed that Druids, a Celtic priestly class, had thought it was their duty to cover their altars with human blood and inspect human entrails to seek divine council. The invasion of the Anglesey Celtic sanctuary was justified by the need to eliminate this priestly class that Tacitus had stated was worshiping at altars soaked with human blood. To be fair to the Celts, later writers argued that Romans had slandered their powerful European enemies. However, contemporary evidence does indicate that human sacrifice could have been practiced by druids, though not regularly. Such sacrifices could have been an ancient form of capital punishment, typically reserved for prisoners and criminals. As the Celts believed in Reincarnation, taking a human life would have had a different meaning for them rather than for those who believed in one lifetime. Human sacrifice victims may not have suffered a painful death such as in Caesar\u2019s Wicker Man. During excavations, bodies in bogs had been found, with nails and skin that was finely cared for, and stomachs full. It is likely such individuals belong to a high or even royal class who had been given special treatment before their death. Some, like the Lindow Man, faced a torturous Threefold Death of drowning, cutting and strangling. Myths like the tale of the High King Conaire, who met his end in the hostel of Da Derga, seem to lend credence to the notion of human sacrifice being a tradition among the Celts."
