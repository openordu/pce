    "text": "Symbolic animal, the cock, drew certain superstitions towards itself, though domestic chickens were predominantly utilized for practical reasons rather than religious ones. The cock was believed to offer a protective shield from danger that could arise unexpectedly, perhaps due to its abrupt cry. Particularly in March, this fortifying power was particularly potent. Black cocks were thought to bring good luck, whilst the opposite was believed for white cocks."
