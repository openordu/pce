    "text": "A Scottish and Irish figure, the Cailleach (also known as Callech, Caillech, Cailliach, Cailleach Bh\u00e9irre, Birrn, B\u00e9arra, Bhear, Beare, Birra in Ireland; Sentainne B\u00e9rri on the Isle of Man, Caillagh ny Groamagh in Ulster, Cally Berry; in Scotland, Cailleach Bheur, Cailliche, and Carlin), is believed to be a goddess and a significant character in folklore. It is thought that she may have originated from a pre-Celtic divinity since the continental Celts did not include her among their ranks, though she is often mentioned in legends and place-names of Ireland and Scotland. Her name, which means \"veiled one\" or \"hooded one,\" is still used in modern Ireland and Scots Gaelic as a term for an old woman or hag. Evidence for her ancientness lies in the names of the largest mountains in Irish and Scottish lands, such as Slieve na Cailleach and Knockycallanan, as well as in tales that say she created the landscape by dropping rocks from her apron or hurling them at enemies, as creation myths tend to be associated with the original divine beings of a land, and settlement in Ireland dates back 7,000 years before the arrival of the Celts. There are legends that tell of how the Cailleach formed Munster's offshore islands by towing around the land with a straw rope that broke, leaving behind Scariff and Deenish. Another story involves her turning a Bull into a rocky island with a blow of her staff as the animal tried to swim away. With only one eye, the Cailleach was depicted as an ancient lady with a blue-grey complexion and an incredibly sharp gaze that could see up to 20 miles clearly, matching her hand's clarity. The Cailleach, though described as unappealing and fearsome, was said to possess an exceptional level of strength, such that she could outmatch even the most competent reaper in the land single-handedly, despite her advanced age. No records, however, suggest that she acted in a hostile manner towards humans\u2014in fact, it was common for her to bestow Sovereignty to the chosen king, who would often have to hug or engage in intimacy with the Cailleach in her hag form before she revealed herself as a stunning young woman. This motif is typically interpreted as an emblematic representation of the land blooming under the reign of a righteous sovereign. These stories may have evolved from a pre-Celtic cosmic narrative, in which the old winter sun's daughter ages gradually into a woman through winter, eventually becoming a lovely, youthful maiden. The Celts who arrived later integrated this tale into their myth of kingly Inauguration. The Cailleach was mainly associated with the Munster region of Ireland, where she went by the name the Hag of Beare, named after a prominent nearby peninsula. On occasion, she assumed the names Beara and Bo\u00ed. Identical sisters, emphasizing her divinity through triplication, were alleged to exist on the neighboring Dingle and Iveraugh peninsulas. These districts were related to the Otherworld in this situation, especially as the site of the Cauldron of plenty, with the Cailleach being hailed as a goddess of plenty, an aspect that was highlighted by her personal name, Bo\u00ed, meaning Cow, a symbol of abundance. The goddess of harvest, known as the Cailleach, was highly revered and respected in traditional folklore. During the autumn harvest season, a sheaf of crops was designated for the Cailleach and kept safe until the following year's harvest. The Cailleach was often represented as an old woman, dressed in women\u2019s clothes, but was said to appear as a hare or other small creature. At the end of each field, shout outs from harvesters were aimed at \"driving the Cailleach\" into the next field. Some people believe that the harvest Cailleach was different from the Hag of Beare, while others saw them both as aspects of the same protective goddess of the land. In Scotland, the spirit of Samhain was referred to as Carlin and marked the end of the harvest. The sheaf representing Carlin was kept in the home as a deterrent for Otherworldly visitors. Unlike other harvest deities, the Scottish Cailleach was not associated with agriculture but was seen as a deer herder who drank deer milk in the wildwood. This weather goddess was sometimes called \u201cthe old gloomy woman\u201d or represented as a crane with sticks in her beak, which forecasted an imminent storm. In winter, stormy weather was attributed to the Cailleach, who was known as the \u201csharp old wife\u201d or Cailleach Bhuer with the \"cutting\" reference probably aimed at winter winds. She was also known as \u201cthe daughter of the little sun,\u201d the sun of winter. In spring, Mumming dances were performed to drive her away, to symbolically replace her with the figure of Bride, a maiden related to Brigit. Legend tells that once the winter-witch Cailleach was frozen into stone, Bride married a hero, and the day of her defeat was celebrated on March 29. On the Isle of Man, there existed a Witch known as the Caillagh ny Groamagh (\u201cgloomy old woman\u201d), who would set out to gather twigs for her fire around Imbolc, marking the beginning of spring. Her actions could either extend the winter or bring about an early spring. This legend is not unique to the Isle of Man, as the image of an aged, hag-like figure who was the guardian of the wildwood and its animals appears in many Celtic legends throughout the insular lands. Her figure originated from an old goddess, who was ultimately conflated with the weather-witch Cailleach. The Cailleach was also known by different names, such as the Hag of the Hair or the Hag of the Long Teeth. In some tales, she was known to punish hunters who killed pregnant animals, causing their deaths by choking them with her hair. She was often accompanied by a monstrous feline. In Scotland, there is a story of the Cailleach befriending a hunter, allowing him to see which deer in her herd was struck, marking it as prey. The Cailleach was also present in Arthurian legends, where she appeared as the Loathy Lady who begged for a kiss from a kingly contender. Percival encountered her as a hag, who mocked him for failing to answer the Fisher King's questions and losing the sacred Grail that could have healed the land. In the famous Arthurian story of Ragnell, she took on the forms of both hag and maiden. One of the most famous medieval Irish poems, composed around the 9th century, speaks of her. A depiction from 900 C.E. of the Cailleach portrays her as a woman mourning her lost beauty and being forced to take the veil in old age. The Christian author of this depiction interpreted the veiled woman as a nun, rather than the former crone goddess. The author of the \u201cLament of the Hag of Beare\u201d tried to suppress the Cailleach\u2019s original nature, but was unsuccessful as she managed to boast about renewing her virginity, like the self-renewing Cailleach of old. Other than her appearances in Gaelic-language literatures, the Cailleach has been portrayed as Milton\u2019s \u201cblew, meager hag\u201d and as Chaucer\u2019s foul \u201colde wyf\u201d in \u201cThe Wife of Bath\u2019s Tale\u201d. A 20th-century Irish poet named Austin Clarke updated the Cailleach\u2019s image in his poem, \u201cThe Young Woman of Beare.\u201d For further information, refer to Glen Lyon."
