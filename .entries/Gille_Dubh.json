    "text": "A Scottish folkloric figure named Gille Dubh, also known as Ghillie Dhu, emerged at the end of the 18th century in the vicinity of Loch a Druing in the Scottish Highlands. This Fairy man was a rather disheveled-looking individual who wore only moss and leaves, and his long, black hair hung around him like a cloak. Despite this, he was a quiet and benevolent type, always willing to aid the lost and help those in need. Unfortunately, certain local lairds chose to use him for target practice, and he was made the subject of their cruel sport. Despite his kind nature, the fairy was forced to disappear without a trace, never to be spotted again, even after a full night's hunting failed to produce him."
