    "text": "Tam Lin, also known as Tamlane or Tam-a-Lin, is a British folkloric hero who was one of the most infamous Fairies in the British border country. A debaucherous young man who frequented Caterhaugh Wood, Tam Lin used to allure maidens away from their families and ruin their lives. Previously human, he was trapped forever after being tricked by the queen of Fairyland who made him cross over its borders. A young girl named Janet fell in love with Tam Lin and made attempts to bring him back to the human realm. To do so, she followed Tam Lin's instructions and went out on Samhain night to watch the Wild Hunt pass on the road. There, she saw a milk-white steed, believing Tam Lin was riding it, grasped him as he rode by. As predicted, she found herself holding an eel, a bear, a lion, and even a spike of fire, but she held on and eventually freed him from enchantment."
