    "text": "The Irish goddess known as Bl\u00e1thnat, also referred to as Blanaid, Blathait, and Bl\u00e1ith\u00edne, was believed to be the daughter of either Midir, the king of Irish Fairies, or Concobar Mac Nessa, the human king of Ulster. Her name means \u201clittle flower.\u201d According to Irish legend, the hero C\u00fachulainn brought her from the Otherworld along with her magical Cattle and Cauldron. However, C\u00fa Ro\u00ed, who was also present during the raid, later stole everything, including Bl\u00e1thnat. C\u00fachulainn suffered more as C\u00fa Ro\u00ed buried him in sand and shaved off his hair, causing others to humiliate him. Bl\u00e1thnat was not happy with C\u00fa Ro\u00ed, and after a year, she conspired with C\u00fachulainn to assassinate C\u00fa Ro\u00ed, with whom she was living. She is the Irish version of the Welsh goddess Blodeuwedd, as she showed C\u00fachulainn the secret way to kill her husband. The story does not end with just one death because C\u00fa Ro\u00ed's poet, Ferchertne, pushed Bl\u00e1thnat over a cliff, killing himself in the process. Bl\u00e1thnat's enslavement by C\u00fa Ro\u00ed caused others to see her as deceitful and treacherous for planning his murder. In a Christian legend, she is said to have converted and entered a convent, thus avoiding being killed."
