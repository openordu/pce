    "text": "In a field outside the small town of Loughrea near Galway City, one finds Turoe Stone, an Irish mythological site that comprises of a human-sized boulder that stands upright, its top embellished with intricate bas-reliefs. The stone was initially located near a rath called Feerwore, but it was moved to its current site during historical times. The Celtic origin of the ornamented stone is indicated by its La T\u00c8NE style. The exact purpose it was intended to serve remains unknown. Nevertheless, other four pillar stones, including Castle Strange in Co. Roscommon, Killycluggin in Co. Cavan, Mullaghmas in Co. Kildare, and Derrykeighan in Co. Antrim, are known to exist in various areas of Ireland. It is hypothesized they served as symbolic central points, similar to the Stone Of Divisions located on the hill of Uisneach, which is said to be Ireland's exact center. One can view a Turoe Stone's replica at the National Museum in Dublin."
