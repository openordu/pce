    "text": "A mythological site in Ireland called Tech Duinn (House of Donn) was believed to be the residence of Donn, an early god who ruled the Otherworld of death. Unlike the more common portrayal of the Otherworld as an exquisitely beautiful place, Tech Duinn was a small rocky island found off the Beare peninsula in western Co. Cork and was perceived to be a sinister and distressing place of darkness. Its association with the regular Otherworld remains vague."
