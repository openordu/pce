    "text": "Symbolic value was attributed to various bird species within Celtic tradition. One such bird was the heron, which dwelt in various elements such as air, land, and water, making it a representation of Otherworld power. In a similar fashion to Cranes, herons were often depicted as emblematic of the feminine force. Notably, there is a story of a bitter satirist named Aithirne who attempted to capture the herons dwelling within the Fairy Mound of Br\u00ed L\u00e9ith. These particular herons were believed to represent the sinful quality of inhospitality."
