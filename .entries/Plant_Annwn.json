    "text": "Welsh fairy creatures known as Plant Annwn (also known as Plant Annwyn or Plant Rhys Dwfen) are well-known in folklore. They were referred to as the \"tribe of the Otherworld\" and the \"tribe of Rhys the Deep\". Plant Annwn lived beneath the surface of lakes where they had their red-eared cattle, known as Gwartheg y Llyn, and teams of white dogs called C'Wn ANNWn. Just like other fairies, the Plant Annwn could mate with humans, however, if their restrictions were violated, they would disappear immediately. The Plant Rhys Dwfen, on the other hand, were a particular subspecies of fairy, who had incredible expertise in marketing, which led to them accumulating substantial wealth."
