    "text": "The symbolic plant known as shamrock has been historically associated with the Celtic culture, although it is not certain whether the clover or the wood sorrel, both referred to as shamrocks, were considered sacred in any way. The Celts held a belief in triplicity as a philosophical and cosmological concept, where many of their revered entities were characterized in threes. According to legend, during St. Patrick's attempt to convert the Druids on Beltane, he presented a shamrock and spoke about the Christian Trinity, the three-in-one god, which was more than just a mere comparison of a complex religious idea with a simple symbol. His use of the shamrock indicated a keen understanding of the significance of three in the Celtic belief system, making his mission easier and more fruitful. Furthermore, when the shamrock bore an extra leaf, making it a rare four-leafed specimen, it was believed to possess the magical qualities required for creating Fairy Ointment."
