    "text": "The idea of sacral kingship is a concept rooted in Celtic society wherein the role of King is not just limited to political implications, but is also regarded as a sacred one. Although there is some evidence to support this belief, the term is quite controversial because of its non-Celtic applications. Generally, the selection of kings was limited to families of royal descent, but in some cases, the Druids used divination or physical prowess to choose lesser-known candidates. After being inaugurated through rituals, the king was expected to follow strict rules and adhere to certain taboos (see Buada and 6S 403 Geis), which are widely accepted in the understanding of Celtic kingship today. However, a minority of scholars fiercely argue, but generally disregarded, that Celtic kings were used as human sacrifices in times of calamity or distress. While there are some mythological references to such occasions (see Conaire), most scholars contend that the kings were deposed rather than being subjected to death, in case of failed crops or other misfortunes. At present, there is still debate on whether this type of kingship counts as a sacred kingship according to other contexts."
