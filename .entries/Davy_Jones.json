    "text": "Davy Jones is a figure in Scottish and Welsh folklore. The ocean is commonly referred to as \u201cDavy Jones\u2019s Locker,\u201d which is believed to have stemmed from a Celtic deity who accessed his Otherworld domain through water. Most rivers in Celtic regions were named after goddesses, but a few in the UK (such as the Tavy and Tay) have origins in the Celtic term taff, meaning \u201cstream,\u201d which could have been transformed into Davy through Christianization. The explanation for the surname Jones, however, is unclear. Some experts point to a Scottish ocean god with a similar name, Shoney, who resided in the Otherworld and imprisoned those who had drowned. As a result, it's possible that the familiar name Davy Jones has ties to a Celtic divinity who detained individuals in the briny deep. Another possibility is that Davy Jones is a combination of the most prevalent first and last names found in Wales, where David is sometimes spelled Davydd. According to this interpretation, the god of the deep is simply a conversational image for the ocean and was popularized by Welsh sailors."
