    "text": "The Arthurian site of Lyonesse was thought to be an island that had been submerged by the sea by British poets, particularly those who dealt with the Arthurian legends from the Matter of Britain. Lyonesse is reportedly located near the Isles of Scilly, in Cornwall, where a rocky outcropping referred to as \u201cthe city\u201d is situated. This tradition combines the themes of the submerged city (refer to Ys, Inchiquin) with that of the floating island of the Celtic Otherworld. This tradition is evoked by Alfred Lord Tennyson when he mentions the \u201csunset bound of Lyonnesse.\u201d"
