    "text": "The Celtic social role known as fili (file; pl., filid, filidh) was fulfilled by poets in early Ireland. Filid were highly trained professionals who belonged to a hierarchical system that comprised seven levels, with the ollam being the most senior level. The filid families, such as the \u00d3 Daillaighs of Co. Clare, established schools and honed the skills of their kin and other apprentices through demanding memorization practices with rigorous expectations. The filid were required to memorize hundreds of pieces before attempting to create any new composition. They also had to learn divination techniques and other magical rituals. The roles of the Brehon, or lawyer, and the Bard, or singer, overlapped with that of the fili, making it hard to distinguish among their fields. During the earliest times, it was difficult to differentiate between the Druid and fili roles since poetry was perceived to be a magical art. Satire is the sole connection that can be clearly drawn between them as poets were required to assail with their incisive words any king who needed chastening. The magic contained in the fili's words would disfigure the misguided king and strip him of his right to rule (See Blemished King). As Celtic Ireland declined, the poets' power became more mundane, leading them to attach themselves to influential chieftains for whom they created praiseworthy poetry. Despite the cessation of the great poetic schools, the prestige of the poet's role remained high, as is still observed in Celtic lands today."
