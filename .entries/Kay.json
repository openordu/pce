    "text": "An Arthurian hero, Kay, who is sometimes known as Kai, Cai, Cei, or Sir Kay, is frequently featured in Arthurian stories as Arthur\u2019s companion, foster brother, and steward. Although he is occasionally kind and bumbling, he can also be quite powerful. According to the Welsh myth of Kulhwch And Olwen, Kay may have initially been a Welsh god of war. This myth depicts him to have beyond-human abilities such as being able to stand underwater for nine days, go without sleep for the same period, warm his comrades during cold weather with only the heat of his body, and stretch himself as tall as the highest tree. Furthermore, if Kay put a pack on his back or engaged in a battle, his backpack would become invisible, and his sword would cause at least one hundred warriors to perish. One of the most notable tales featuring Kay is the abduction of Queen Guinevere by a king named Meleagant. Kay, along with Lancelot, tracked Meleagant to his castle, where Kay sustained injuries while trying to rescue the queen. The injured Kay slept in the same room as Guinevere. Lancelot visited the queen's bed, which caused bloodstains on the sheets. Kay was accused of taking advantage of the queen the next day, but Lancelot fought to defend his friend's honor. It is speculated by certain experts that Kay was a deity of Celtic peoples who were Arthur's tribes' conventional adversaries. This assertion connects the heroes of legend to the reality of political links established in the past."
