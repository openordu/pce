    "text": "Folklore features the motif of elf-shot, also known as elf-smitten. Fairies were not unarmed when attacking humans or animals, as they had miniature arrows they could use as weapons. Despite their almost invisibility, they could cause tremendous damage due to their great force. It is said that a single elf-shot was powerful enough to incapacitate a cow. Those struck by such an arrow would experience either partial or full paralysis, referred to as Fairy Stroke."
