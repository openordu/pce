    "text": "A name that stands out in Irish legend is Fachtna, a hero whose origins have inspired several stories. However, there is only one Fachtna of importance in Irish mythology. Fachtna F\u00e1thach, the king of Ulster, was married to a girl named Assa, meaning \"gentle\" in her original form. Unfortunately, one day, the evil Druid Cathbad murdered her beloved tutors in an attempt to violate and ravish her. After this tragic event, Assa transformed into the warrior Nessa, meaning \"ungentle.\" It is unclear whether Cathbad's attempt was successful, but Nessa later bore a son who came into the world holding a Worm in his hand. She claimed that she conceived her child after drinking from a glass in which two worms were swimming, thus becoming magically impregnated. The boy, whose name was Concobar Mac Nessa, bore his mother's name but was raised by Fachtna and eventually took over the throne of Ulster."
