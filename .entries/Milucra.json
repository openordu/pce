    "text": "Milucra is an Irish goddess, the lesser-known sister of the goddess \u00c1ine. She developed an infatuation with the renowned hero, Fionn Mac Cumhaill, who was also desired by \u00c1ine. As \u00c1ine had pledged never to be with a gray-haired man, Milucra placed a spell on a lake at Slieve Gullion in Ulster. This curse would turn the hair of any swimmer gray. Fionn, a young and virile man, encountered a beautiful maiden on the lake's shores who claimed to have dropped her golden ring into the water. He volunteered to swim out and retrieve the ring, which he successfully managed to do. But when he resurfaced, he was both gray-haired, unappealing to the sensuous \u00c1ine, and withered with age. Milucra was captured by the Fianna and compelled to provide their leader with a drink that would restore his youth. However, his hair retained its silver hue."
