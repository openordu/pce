    "text": "A legendary figure in Breton folklore is Mary Morgan, also known as Morrigain. According to tales, she is a siren or mermaid who would haunt the coasts of Brittany, singing beautifully to lure sailors towards her treacherous rocks. The Bay of Douaranez is a particular location where she is often associated, as it is where the princess Dahut supposedly erected her crystal city of Ys. It was said that sailors ought to have a crucifix or another type of amulet with them when passing by the rocks where Mary Morgan resided in order to be protected."
