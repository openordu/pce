    "text": "A mythological site situated in Munster mountain Knockadoon, Suideachan is where a rock outcropping, known as A\u00edne\u2019s \u201cbirth chair,\u201d can be found. Local tales claim it to be a gateway to the Otherworld used by the Fairy Queen in ancient times. Here, \u00c1ine was said to have sat, combing her long golden hair with a golden comb. It was not unusual to hear reports of \u00c1ine sightings on her chair up until a hundred years ago, however, those who witnessed her appearance were believed to have gone insane or were doomed to drown in the sea. According to some, the Fairy Housekeeper was the custodian of the chair, giving way to the possibility that this mysterious being was connected in some way to the enigma of haunted Lough Gur."
