    "text": "An Irish goddess named Nemain, also called Neman or Neamhan, was one of the three M\u00f3rr\u00edgna - a trio of war goddesses. Nemain was not as prominent as Badb, who was known as \u201cscald crow\u201d and M\u00f3rr\u00edgan, who was referred to as \u201cgreat queen\u201d or \u201cqueen of phantoms\u201d. However, Nemain's name suggested that she was the goddess of \u201cbattle panic\u201d or \u201cfrenzy of war\u201d. She had the ability to make warriors so frenzied that they sometimes mistook their allies for enemies, leading to tragedies known as \u201cfriendly fire\u201d. Although she was briefly described in various documents as confusing warriors with her weird cries, like other war goddesses, Nemain was believed to take the form of a crow, hovering over battlefields like other carrion eaters waiting for their next meal. As her name might be connected to the Celtic term for an outdoor shrine, Nemeton, she could symbolize the obligation of warriors to safeguard sacred sites."
