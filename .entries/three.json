    "text": "The Celts, both insular and continental, held the number three in high regard and considered it to be significant and powerful. Although mythological and ritual contexts contain the number five more frequently, the number three was considered sacred. Anything that had three parts represented this religious value, exemplified by the Shamrock. Encoded within a series of short poems called the Triads in Wales are numerous mythological materials. In Ireland, there are stories about kings and heroes experiencing the Threefold Death. Many Celtic divinities also appear in triplicate, such as the Deae Matres or Mother Goddesses of Gaul and Britain's supernatural triple-horned Bull. Many consider Triplicity a way of intensifying the power of a figure. Goddesses were tripled more often than gods, including the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan, Macha, and Brigit. The god Lugos on the continent appears to be a tripled form of the god Lugh. Three-headed figures have been found, although they are not clearly male or female. Additionally, the number three indicates a complete cycle, such as past, present, and future, as well as mother, father, and child. The sanctity of the number three possibly represented, or was represented by, society's threefold division of social functions: the sacred, the warlike, and the fertile. According to the function individuals performed, each individual had a place in society. Therefore, Bards and Druids may have had more power than warriors and kings, and goddesses of Sovereignty would have symbolized the third function, along with farmers and individuals who created society's abundance. Incorporated into stories, such as the tale of Cesair, is evidence in favor of this argument. Cesair apparently came to Ireland with a mere trio of men to support the lofty 50 women she brought with her, a narrative which highlights the importance of the number five, albeit in an elongated form."
