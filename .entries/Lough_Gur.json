    "text": "Surrounded by low hills, each connected with a goddess or god, Lough Gur is a small lake in County Limerick that has been inhabited for almost six millennia. Standing as the site of the largest surviving stone circle in all of Ireland, the Grange, this lake is also widely believed to be an entrance into the Otherworld. This is a belief that is common to the Celtic lands, where people of the time saw water as the dividing line between the world of the Fairies and the world they inhabited. In the many legends tied to the lake, a cycle of time, usually occurring every seven years, emerges as a central point. During each passing of this cycle, distinctive events take place. The water within the lake is said to empty out, and passersby notice a tree growing from the lake bed. This tree is perceived as being covered with a green cloth, under which a woman named Toice Bhrean is seated and knitting. Similarly, the goddess or fairy queen named \u00c1ine, along with her enchanted son named Ger\u00f3id Iarla, are said to be visible at Lough Gur each time the seven-year cycle comes to an end. Ger\u00f3id Iarla was born to \u00c1ine after her liaison with Maurice, the Earl of Desmond. Maurice saw her swimming in the shape of a swan and stole her cloak so that he could capture her. As is common with other marriages of this kind, the bride placed a taboo on the groom. In this case, Maurice was forbidden to show any surprise whatsoever, no matter what their son might do. At a banquet, Ger\u00f3id, now fully grown, reduced himself to a tiny size and leaped into a bottle, and then out again, resuming his regular shape. When Maurice called out in amazement, Ger\u00f3id was forced to disappear into Lough Gur, where he appeared on the surface of the water in the shape of a goose. On Garrod Island, a fairy takes on human form every seven years when he leaves the lake. Riding a white horse, he leads the Wild Hunt across the land. Next to the lake stands the chair-shaped monument called the Suidheachan or \u201chousekeeper\u2019s seat,\u201d where the Fairy Housekeeper is said to appear. As legend has it, the housekeeper once fell asleep while the dwarf harper, \u00c1ine\u2019s brother Fer \u00cd, stole her Comb. This comb\u2013a symbol of female anatomy\u2013may suggest that the theft was a rape. In response, the housekeeper cursed the cattle in the region, as well as the dwarf. Fer \u00cd returned the comb, but to no avail, as the curse remained and he died. The fairies believed another fairy woman or the housekeeper drowns a human in the lake waters once every seven years. The fairy race, who frequently abducts children from its shores, is believed to be the inhabitants of the lands around the lake."
