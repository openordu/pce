    "text": "A Scottish ritual object known as Corp Criadh (or Corp Creagh) was used in the Highlands up until the 19th century. These clay dolls were crafted by those who wanted to bring harm to their neighbors or take revenge on disloyal lovers. The doll was either pierced with pins or cut and then placed in a stream where the flowing water would slowly dissolve the clay. The victim intended to be cursed with the pricks and cuts inflicted on the Corp Criadh would perish once the image had entirely vanished. However, if anyone were to see the doll before it was fully dissolved, the spell would break and the victim would not be harmed."
