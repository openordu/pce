    "text": "A goddess named Inghean Bhuidhe is recognized in Irish mythology as one of three connected goddesses based in the Munster province. Referred to as \u201cthe yellow-haired girl,\u201d she was the Sister of Latiaran, who was believed to be an ancient fire goddess, as well as another fire deity called Crobh Dearg or \u201cred claw,\u201d with the third sister sometimes identified as Lasair. Following her conversion to Christianity, Inghean Bhuidhe was venerated as a Saint with ceremonies held by a sacred Well every May 6. While she is regarded as a vital figure in her limited geographical area, information about her abilities remain scarce."
