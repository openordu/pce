    "text": "A goddess from Irish mythology, Echthge (also known as Aughty, Echtga, and Eghchte), is remembered in the area of the Slieve Aughty (or Sliabh na Echthge) hills in east Co. Clare. The land, which is named after the goddess, is said to have been given to her as a dowry after she slept with the land's owner. Echthge was the daughter of Nuada of the Silver Hand, and little is known about her, except for her titles such as \"the awful one\" or \"awful daughter and terrible goddess.\" She is also associated with a fragmentary legend in which she killed and ate her own children. Interestingly, due to the prevalence of Cailleach, a pre-Celtic Hag goddess, in the region, many place-names in the area are derived from her name. As such, it is possible that the Celtic Echthge was either absorbed or merged with the older Cailleach divinity. Today, the Slieve Aughty area is famous for its association with the White Witch of Clare, Biddy Early, and the area is known as the site where much of the earliest published Irish folklore originates from. The area is also close to Coole Park, the demesne of Lady Augusta Gregory, and where the poet W.B. Yeats wrote about \"fair Eghte of the streams.\""
