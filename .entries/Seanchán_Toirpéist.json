    "text": "Seanch\u00e1n Toirp\u00e9ist, alternatively known as Sench\u00e1n, Sench\u00e1n Torp\u00e9ist or possibly Sench\u00e1n mac Uarchride, was an Irish hero who is believed to have lived in the late sixth or early seventh century C.E. However, his life was not quite as it was recorded by his biographers. Similar to some Irish Saints of the time, Seanch\u00e1n was given mythical attributes such as the ability to bring the dead back to life and fight with magical Cats. He was associated with the court of the legendary king Guaire of Connacht, where he discovered that none of the poets in Ireland were able to recite the full epic, the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge. In an effort to rectify this, he journeyed to the grave of one of the T\u00e1in\u2019s heroes, queen Medb's lover Fergus mac Roich, and invoked the hero from the Otherworld with the help of his son, Muirghein. Fergus appeared and recited the T\u00e1in, which Seanch\u00e1n memorized as it was being spoken. When the ghost of Fergus reappeared at Guaire\u2019s Court, Seanch\u00e1n fell over dead. There are various versions of the account, one of which states that Seanch\u00e1n died of embarrassment because he was unable to recite the T\u00e1in when requested by the king, while in another version, he died, leaving his son to clear his name by summoning Fergus through magic."
