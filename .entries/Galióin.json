    "text": "A legendary Irish clan, Gali\u00f3in (also known as Gailioin, G\u00e1lian, Galioin) of unclear lineage, is detailed in two significant mythological accounts: the quasi-historical Book Of Invasions and the epic T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge. The former narrates their involvement as part of the invading Fir Bolg people, and the latter highlights their fearsome reputation, which nearly leads queen Medb to order their execution rather than risk going against them as allies. However, Fergus mac R\u00f3ich, her lover, convinces her that they would be more valuable when dispersed among the troops. These people possibly signify a primitive Celtic tribal faction."
