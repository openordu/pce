    "text": "A helpful Scottish mythological character known as the gunna was responsible for cattle herding specifically in the Scottish islands. This figure would frequent small farms and guard them to ensure cows did not trample the garden. Despite harsh weather conditions, the gunna would remain naked, as was common for many helpful sprites. Interestingly, any effort to dress the gunna would result in its departure, as noted by the folkloric belief of Laying The Fairies."
