    "text": "The ritual of namegiving was a common Celtic practice that involved baptizing children with water from a sacred source. Evidence from texts suggests that this tradition required children to be splashed with water from a sacred water-source. The famous hero, Ailill Mac M\u00e1ta, was said to have been \u201cbaptized in druidic streams\u201d while Gwri from Wales received \u201cbaptism which was usual.\u201d In Ireland, it was believed that the power of the local goddess resided in holy wells. Baptism with the goddess's water symbolized acceptance into her community. Even in recent times, it was customary to protect newborn children from Fairy Kidnapping in the Hebrides. This was done by placing three drops of water on their foreheads, which can be traced back to a historic baptismal ritual."
