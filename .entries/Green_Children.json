    "text": "Mythology and history converge in the story of the Green Children, two figures who appeared in Suffolk in the 12th century with green skin and hair. They were a boy and a girl who spoke a language that was unknown and rejected the meat they were offered even though they seemed to be starving. Their arrival was sudden and abrupt, and shortly after emerging from a hole beneath a felled tree, the boy died. His sister, on the other hand, learned to speak and was able to communicate with her rescuers. She explained that she and her brother were from a race that lived beneath the ground in a place called St. Martin's Land. She described it as a land with constant rainfall which was otherwise similar to the world aboveground. She further related that they became lost while caring for their flocks and ended up on the surface world by chance. Although she married later, she continued visiting the place of her emergence until she eventually vanished, presumably to search for her way back home. There are some recent viewpoints that suggest that the children were not Fairies as their pigmentation seemed to imply, but instead, their green hue was a result of malnutrition, and that they were probably just missing children from a conflict-riddled area of England who arrived on the unfamiliar \"surface\" via abandoned mineshafts."
