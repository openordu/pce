    "text": "Welsh mythology is based on stories compiled as the Mabinogion, which consist of four branches and sometimes include an additional eight tales. The Mabinogion offers insight into the Celtic past as the narratives, written after Christianization, are based on earlier oral literature of Wales. The stories, which concern the Children of D\u00f4n, are found in The White Book of Rhydderch and The Red Book of Hergest. While the origin of the name \"Mabinogion\" is derived from an obscure boy god, Mabon or Maponus, and from the term for a young poet, \"mabinog,\" specialists today prefer to use the term \"mabinogi.\" It is believed that the stories were a training manual for Bards-to-be. The Children of D\u00f4n, who are parallel to the Irish divinities of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, are the descendants of a little-known goddess named D\u00f4n, whose children's father is not mentioned. Consequently, some scholars infer that the Mabinogion dates from a time when matriliny was common. The Mabinogion's stories were first translated into English and published by Lady Charlotte Guest between 1838-1849. Evangeline Walton's renditions of the Mabinogion tales in the mid-twentieth century were inspired by a particular interpretation. The first branch of the Mabinogion focuses on Pwyll, the prince of Dyfed, who agreed to swap realms with the king of Annwn, the Otherworld, called Arawn. Hafgan, a formidable warrior, was attacking Arawn's kingdom, and only one stroke could vanquish him. Pwyll consented to take on Hafgan and successfully defeated him with a single strike, thus saving Annwn and earning Arawn's eternal gratitude. Soon after, Pwyll encountered the beautiful princess Rhiannon, whose Otherworldly origin and swift Horse marked her as a divinity. Pwyll had to battle Gwawl, who also desired Rhiannon, to win her hand. Though he succeeded, their union was not a happy one, as their baby vanished on Beltane night. Traces of blood found around Rhiannon's mouth caused accusations that she had eaten their child. She was spared, but from then on had to carry visitors on her back as if she were a horse. Later events revealed her innocence when the lost child was discovered being raised by someone else. The young prince returned to his true family and cleared his mother's name, bringing joy to the land. The second branch of the Mabinogion narrates the heroic journey to Ireland undertaken by Br\u00e2n the Blessed and his warriors who attempt to rescue Princess Branwen, who's been taken captive. The children of Llyr were Br\u00e2n, Branwen, the hero Manawydan, and the half brothers Nisien and EFNisien. Br\u00e2n and Manawydan agreed to have Branwen marry the Irish warlord Matholwch, hoping it would lead to a happy life. However, during the wedding, Efnisien disfigured Matholwch\u2019s horses, leading to strife for both Branwen and Matholwch. Despite bearing an heir named Gwern, Branwen suffered at the hands of the Irish, eventually sending a starling to her brothers in Wales to alert them to her situation. They waged a war to free her, at the expense of many lives. Ultimately, Branwen died of a broken heart during her journey home. The third branch of the Mabinogion tells the story of Manawydan and Pryderi, son of Pwyll and Rhiannon. The two men wed Rhiannon and Cigfa at a double ceremony, respectively. Afterward, they discovered that their land was barren and covered in a strange mist. They found a way to live for a time by hunting, before becoming shoemakers in eastern Britain. Their work was so impressive that other craftsmen became envious and threatened them, causing them to return to Wales. Pryderi and Rhiannon were not spared from their fates as they both vanished into thin air under a spell. It was later discovered that the curse had been placed on them by Gwawl's allies, who sought revenge on Pryderi's father for humiliating Gwawl in front of Rhiannon. Fortunately, after resolving the long-standing conflict, all the couples were reunited in happiness. The fourth branch of the story tells of the tale of the rape of Goewin, who held the ceremonial foot-holder position for King Math, and the consequent complications regarding her successor. Gwydion, Math's nephew, was Math's chosen heir - a clear indication of matrilineal social organization - and naturally, Gwydion's sister Arianrhod desired to serve as the foot-holder. However, before she could be appointed, she had to fulfill a magical test established by Math, which was to prove her virginity by stepping over a magician\u2019s staff. The test eventually resulted in the hasty births of two children, one of which was Dylan, son of the sea, and the other was an unformed bundle of flesh who Gwydion took under his custody. Outraged at having been deceived, Arianrhod swore she would deny the son she birthed a name, as well as any arms - two responsibilities of the mother. Lleu Llaw Gyffes was the name of the cursed boy which Arianrhod had reluctantly given in anger. However, Gwydion had once again tricked her into naming and arming her son. As revenge, Arianrhod declared that Lleu would never have a wife from this earth. Yet, again Math and Gwydion found a way to circumvent the curse by creating Lleu's bride, the flower-maiden Blodeuwedd, using a pile of flowers. In the end, Blodeuwedd killed Lleu with the help of her lover, Gronw Pebyr. Other significant mythological tales in the historic Welsh collection known as the Mabinogion are often discussed in addition to the four primary branches. These additional narratives consist of the Dream of Maxen, the tale of Kulhwch and Olwen, Owein's escapades as he endeavors to win the Lady of the Fountain, and the story of Taliesin, the reincarnated bard."
