    "description": "A lord hauls in a strange creature, a sort of Eel with nine mouths. He throws it down a Well\u2014still locally called Worm\u2019s Well\u2014and sets about to reform his life. He even goes to the Crusades. Meanwhile, in the well, the worm is growing larger and larger, until it emerges a true monster to ravage the countryside and kill all the knights sent to combat it. When the lord returns from the Holy Land, he finds his lands in disarray and his people in fear.",

    "text": "The Lambton Worm is a well-known dragon figure in British folklore. Although the name \"worm\" signifies a small creature, it actually denotes a dragon in Norse and Saxon tongues. The story narrates how a reckless 14th-century lord went fishing instead of attending church on a Sunday morning, even though the chapel was in plain sight. After having trouble catching fish for some time that day, he finally caught a peculiar creature, which had nine mouths and looked like an eel. Out of fear and horror, he threw it into the Worm's Well, which is still known by the same name today, and resolved to change his ways. As time passed, the worm grew abnormally large and evolved into a monstrous beast that wrought destruction and killed all the knights who tried to defeat it. Upon returning from the Crusades, the lord learned of the chaos and distress that had befallen his people and his lands. Consumed with guilt, he vowed to annihilate the worm. He sought advice from a wise woman who recommended that he must get a Smith to forge spiky armor and confront the beast on a rock located in the middle of the River Wear. She also cautioned the lord that he must kill the first creature he saw upon reaching home after his victory. With foresight, the lord arranged for a dog to be let out upon his arrival at his castle and then embarked on a quest to battle the monstrous worm. The worm put up a great fight, but it eventually became impaled on the spikes of the lord\u2019s armor and died. Unfortunately, in the midst of the lord\u2019s homecoming celebrations, his elderly father rushed over to congratulate him. The lord swiftly put an end to the dog that had been let out as the chosen victim, yet this was not enough to fulfill the conditions laid out by the old woman. As a consequence, no lord of Lambton managed to live until old age for nine generations."
