    "text": "An Irish god, Manann\u00e1n mac Lir (Manandan, Monanaun, Mananan, Oirbsiu) is portrayed as an oceanic deity, the son of Lir, an ancient and enigmatic god of the sea. Unlike other gods, he never resided on land, preferring instead to make his home in the ocean on an island known by various names including Mag Mell (\"plain of honey\"), T\u00edr Tairngiri (\"land of promise\"), and Emain Ablach (\"island of apples\"). The latter has been linked to the Arthurian world of Avalon on occasion. Shape-shifting was his key skill, which made him akin to the Greek Proteus, the origin of our word \"protean,\" meaning many-formed. He could grant this power to those he favored and who favored him, which made him beloved among Bards and Divination practitioners. Manann\u00e1n had a considerable number of mystical powers. He traveled faster than the wind across the sea, in a copper boat that was propelled on its own, drawn by a steed named Enbharr (\"splendid mane\" or \"water-foam\"), whose mane, a wash of the billows, was the hairdo of Manann\u00e1n. He could make a small group look like an entire army and a handful of chips appear like a fleet of warships on the brine. His cloak was magic, capable of inciting forgetfulness when he shook it out. Although he was not originally one of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, the most prominent deities of ancient Ireland, by the 10th century he was considered part of their group. He was accepted among them because, according to some tales, it was he who suggested that rather than leaving Ireland once and for all, the Tuatha D\u00e9 should live under the hills. To the tribe of Danu, Manann\u00e1n provided three gifts which were the Druid\u2019S Fog or cloak of concealment, the feast of Goibniu that warded off old age and his magical Pigs which could be put to death every day and consumed every night before being revived every morning. In some texts by the Irish scribe Cormac, Manann\u00e1n was depicted as a sailor of remarkable celestial navigational ability and was often shown as a human figure. Due to exhaustion from the Irish landscape, he relocated his operations to Scotland and appeared in numerous folktales under a different guise. The Isle of Man was named after Manann\u00e1n and his resting place can still be observed there with the ocean being a constant reminder of his presence. The lore of Manann\u00e1n in other Celtic regions was limited, however, the sustained existence of the Manx dialect meant that sea-god traditions have retained their significance up till modern times. Until the start of the 1800s, there was limited communication between Isle of Man and other nations, and the residents on the island could not converse fluently in English. Nonetheless, with time the Manx dialect, a Gaelic branch that varied from the languages spoken in Ireland and Wales, started to decline in the 19th century and the last Manx speaker perished in the latter half of the 20th century. The island named for Manann\u00e1n was ruled by him, according to myth. He resided in a castle atop Mount Barrule, where he is entombed, while his burial mound is said to exist on the shore beneath Peel Castle in some accounts. Manann\u00e1n\u2019s Chair, a lookout point over the sea, was where he supposedly kept vigil. Manx fishermen claimed that as they fixed their nets, Manann\u00e1n, accompanied by a strange being with three legs but neither head nor torso, which symbolized the restless sea and also the crest of the Isle of Man, would walk along the seashore to them. Manann\u00e1n was linked to various fairy women and goddesses. Most renowned among them was his daughter or wife Fand, who was referred to as Fairyland\u2019s \u201cpearl of beauty\u201d and posed the only challenge to the idealized marriage of the hero C\u00fachulainn and his ideal woman, Emer. Manann\u00e1n was also identified with \u00c1ine, the Sun goddess, who rose from his watery bed each morning; however, other tales referred to her as Manann\u00e1n\u2019s daughter instead of his partner. The heroes Gaiar and Mong\u00e1n were his offspring."
