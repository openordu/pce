    "text": "A tale of a passionate woman named Gr\u00e1inne (also known as Grania, Grainne, and Grace) is a well-known story from the Fenian Cycle that has been shared in numerous different versions. The story begins with a race up the Munster mountain named Slievenamon, which is known as \u201cthe mountain of the women\u201d. After the aging hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill declared that he planned to marry the fastest woman in all of Ireland, the audacious princess Gr\u00e1inne decided that she was the one who deserved this honor. Fionn sat at the top of the mountain while all of the women raced to reach him on his signal. Swift and bold, Gr\u00e1inne was the first to reach him and the wedding was set. There are conflicting details about her origins, with various texts claiming that Gr\u00e1inne was a princess of Ulster, Munster, or Tara. However, most agree that the wedding celebration was hosted on the royal hill of Tara, where a structure known as Rath Gr\u00e1inne still exists. During the wedding fete, Gr\u00e1inne noticed that her new betrothed was much older than herself. As the party continued, she looked around the gathering of heroes of Fionn\u2019s band, the Fianna, and happened upon Diarmait Ua Duibne, a young man with many admirable qualities, but the most alluring of all was hidden. A dimple or birthmark known as a Ball Seirc resided on Diarmait\u2019s forehead, and any woman who saw it became madly in love. Either a cap or bangs perpetually covered the Ball Seirc, but as Diarmait was playing with Fionn\u2019s hounds at the festival, he flipped his hair, exposing the mark. Gr\u00e1inne had an instant and overwhelming love for Diarmait. This idea of fated love is also present in the story of Tristan and Iseult, where they mistakenly share a love potion. Initially, Diarmait had no interest in running away with the wife of his leader, who happened to be one of Ireland\u2019s most formidable warriors. However, he did not count on Gr\u00e1inne\u2019s determination. Gr\u00e1inne discovered that Diarmait was under a sacred vow called Geis that dictated he could never refuse a woman who approached him while neither clothed nor unclothed, neither on foot nor on horseback, not even in dark or daylight. Gr\u00e1inne took advantage of this and arrived at sunset, veiled in mountain mist and sitting on a Goat, forcing him to elope with her away from Fionn. According to some accounts, Gr\u00e1inne drugged the Fianna, including her former intended partner, sparing only Diarmait, the man she desired, and convincing him to leave with her. The two fled towards the Shannon River, sleeping in the Wood of the Two Tents on their way. Diarmait refused to sleep in the same tent as Gr\u00e1inne, fearing Fionn would catch them. Gr\u00e1inne still convinced Diarmait by lightly suggesting how pleasant it was that someone found her desirable. Feeling guilty, Diarmait eventually joined Gr\u00e1inne in her tent. Fionn and the rest of the Fianna were in close pursuit of the couple. However, Gr\u00e1inne and Diarmait managed to stay one step ahead of them, with Gr\u00e1inne concealed by an invisibility cloak while Diarmait jumped incredible distances to avoid danger. Each night they rested on a different bed made of stone. Thus, the Irish countryside now possesses Dolmens that are recognized as the \u201cbeds of Diarmait and Gr\u00e1inne.\u201d They ran together at a considerable pace, so much so that they never spent more than one night in any given location or enjoyed cooked meals. However, their constant travel eventually wore them down, and they sought solace with a giant named Searbhan, who allowed the pair to take shelter in his Rowan tree that had magical properties. However, they were admonished not to consume the tree\u2019s berries. Gr\u00e1inne, however, was hungry and couldn't resist; when she ate the berries, Diarmait killed Searbhan, resulting in the couple\u2019s location being discovered by the pursuing Fionn due to the giant's death cries. Diarmait and Gr\u00e1inne hid from Fionn atop the tree by climbing up quickly, but their former suitor eventually discovered their location. Fionn sat under the tree and started to play Fidchell, a board game similar to cribbage, with his friend Ois\u00edn the Bard. Diarmait couldn't resist helping his friend by dropping berries onto the board from above, inadvertently giving away their position. And so, the chase recommenced until Aonghus \u00f3g, a god, interceded and persuaded Fionn to forgive the lovers, and they were granted restoration. Instead of returning to Fionn\u2019s fort at the Almu, the pair withdrew to Gr\u00e1inne\u2019s rath near the enchanting Keshcorran cave in Co. Sligo. Fionn finally exacted his revenge by deceiving Diarmait into a dangerous boar hunt on top of the legendary peak of Ben BULBen. Diarmait was under a geis, a taboo, that forbade him from hunting a boar, and in the hunt, he faced Gulben, a man whom his father had killed, which resulted in the man being enchanted into a fierce boar. After killing the magical boar and leaving Diarmait unscathed, Fionn once again mocked his rival, forcing him to measure the length of the beast\u2019s corpse. As Diarmait paced, a sharp bristle pierced his skin, causing him to collapse and bleed profusely. He pleaded with Fionn to bring him water, which he did, only to let it drain from his hands as Diarmait lay dying. The dying man commented that Gr\u00e1inne would appreciate seeing his beautiful body, now covered in blood and gore. This event has led many to interpret Gr\u00e1inne, whose name harbours the word Sun within it, as a weakened goddess of Sovereignty who chose Diarmait over the faltering Fionn, signifying the transference of power to the younger man. Furthermore, the couple\u2019s journey across Ireland may be read as an echo of the king\u2019s journey through his territories with a goddess, as well as the daily movement of the sun across the land."
