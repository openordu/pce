    "text": "The concept of immovability, or automatic return, is a motif found in folklore. The impressive great stone monuments of the pre-Celtic people led to the development of many superstitions surrounding these sites. These beliefs remained intact for millennia after the builders had passed away, serving as a means of preserving the stones against desecration. According to the early British historian Nennius, one of these superstitions was that if such stones were moved from their sacred location, they would return the next day on their own power. In some cases, the thief who had moved the stone would be hurt or killed upon its return."
