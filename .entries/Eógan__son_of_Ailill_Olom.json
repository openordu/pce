    "text": "E\u00f3gan, the founder of E\u00f3ganacht (Owenacht) dynasty of southern Ireland, was the son of Ailill Olom and the grandson of E\u00f3gan M\u00f3r. One day, while resting with his foster brother, Lugaidh mac Conn, they heard enchanting music coming from a yew tree, which was the meaning of E\u00f3gan\u2019s name, where a harper, Fer \u00cd, which also means \u201cyew,\u201d played his harp. E\u00f3gan and Lugaidh attempted to speak to him but in vain. Despite the hypnotic harmony of the music, they became enemies, and Lugaidh\u2019s manservant Do Dera took his place in the battle and was killed by E\u00f3gan. In a moment of confusion and shock, E\u00f3gan believed he had killed his brother but soon realized that Lugaidh had escaped. They encountered each other once again, this time with a Druid named Dil Maccu Crecga, who enchanted E\u00f3gan. The druid foresaw that E\u00f3gan would father a son with his daughter, Moncha, and their children would become the kings of Munster. After E\u00f3gan fathered a son with Moncha, he died in battle."
