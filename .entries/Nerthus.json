    "text": "Nerthus is a well-known Germanic goddess with a cult that had a profound influence on the rituals of Celtic goddesses. This suggests that there might have been either a shared origin for these rituals, or the nearby cultures influenced each other. The Roman general and geographer, Tacitus, provides a description of the worship of Nerthus on a sacred island where no human was allowed to enter. This is an image commonly found in Celtic lore, representing the Otherworld. Occasionally, Nerthus would feel a desire to leave her sacred island and travel among her followers. She was then pulled on an ox-driven cart and welcomed with great celebration. All warfare stopped while the goddess was present in the land since her passing was believed to bring fertility to fields. At the end of her procession, she was transported back to her sacred island, and those who had attended her were put to death. This was thought to ensure that no one could live after looking upon the goddess's face. The Cart bearing the goddess is also found in Celtic contexts, and it is believed that the Celts may have practiced human sacrifice."
