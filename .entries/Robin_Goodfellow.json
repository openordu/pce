    "text": "Robin Goodfellow is a well-known character in British folklore. He appears in Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream where Puck, a mischievous Fairy, is merged with Robin Goodfellow, son of a fairy king, sometimes referred to as Oberon, and a human mother. In British folktales, Robin Goodfellow was infamous for getting into trouble as a child. Once his mother threatened to whip him, he fled and became an apprentice to a tailor. Even as he grew older, he continued to cause mischief until his mother threatened him again. He then left to search for his father. Robin was reunited with his father and learned the craft of Shape-Shifting, which he then used to settle down and become a diligent Brownie who worked hard to help others."
