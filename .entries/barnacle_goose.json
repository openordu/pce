    "text": "A waterbird with a fascinating folklore backstory is the barnacle goose, considered a symbol in Ireland for many reasons. One peculiar belief associated with this bird is that it was labeled as a fish, thus making it acceptable to be consumed during Lenten fasts. Although it is unknown if this belief had mythological roots or originated from later folklore, it does have foundations in ancient Celtic beliefs that consider birds as magical beings composed of several elements. It is also possible that the bird's significance in Irish folklore may predate Celtic times, as a barnacle goose was found in a Neolithic house where it may have served as a sacrificial foundation, indicating its potential role as a protective being. This migratory wildfowl's cyclic disappearance and reappearance may have also made it more special to the Irish. For more information on the barnacle goose and its significance, see Goose."
