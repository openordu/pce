    "text": "A British folkloric figure and location called Gillian (or Jillian) were known for mazes cut into the turf known as Gillian Bowers. These mazes were used for races where young men would participate during the springtime. At the center of the maze, a woman dressed as the figure Gillian was \"imprisoned\" and then \"freed\" by the winner of the race. A similar type of maze, called Troy Towns, can be found in Scandinavian countries, although its origin remains unexplained. The game seems to imply a ritual of freeing the Sun maiden from her winter captivity. It is possible that the goddess Gillian, who may have been associated with springtime, gave her name to these locations."
