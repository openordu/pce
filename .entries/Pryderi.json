    "text": "In the Mabinogion, the first book of Welsh mythology, the hero Pryderi, also known as Gwri, was born to Rhiannon, a magical woman who may have originally been a goddess, and the human prince Pwyll. Rhiannon appeared riding a swift horse and was pursued by Pwyll, who could not catch her until he simply asked her to stop. They married but their happiness was short-lived when their son Pryderi disappeared from his cradle. Unbeknownst to the court, he had been snatched away by an Otherworldly being, but was later rescued by a noble farmer named Teyrnon Twf Liant and raised under the name Gwri. After learning the truth of his birth, Pryderi set out to claim his inheritance and cleared his mother's name of the false accusation that she had murdered him. The family lived happily until a curse caused their land to be engulfed in a magical mist and all the cattle and people disappeared, as recounted in the third branch of the Mabinogion. Pwyll had passed away, and Rhiannon had wed the royal Manawydan. Pryderi had also married a lovely lady named Cigfa. Unbeknownst to anyone, the friends of a suitor who had been turned down for Rhiannon's hand still nursed a grudge against her for the humiliation they suffered. As a result, Pryderi and his mother were enchanted and imprisoned until their spouses could figure out how to rescue them."
