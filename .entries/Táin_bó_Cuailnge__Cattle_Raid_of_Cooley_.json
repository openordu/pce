    "text": "The Irish epic known as T\u00e1in b\u00f3 Cuailnge (Cattle Raid of Cooley) is the greatest existing piece of Irish mythological literature. The story tells of a massive Cattle Raid that took place in what is now known as the Cooley peninsula, and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as the Cattle Raid of Cooley. The tale is part of the Ulster Cycle of myths and was documented in the Middle Ages by Christian monks from the prominent central monastery of Conmacnoise, though its material dates back to an earlier time period. It is believed that the story was orally conveyed for centuries by Celtic Bards before being transcribed. In addition to the central story, there are several fore-tales or remsc\u00e9la that explain the reasons behind the Cattle Raid. These tales include well-known stories from Irish literature such as the rape of the maiden Nessa by the druid Cathbad and the birth of the king Concobar Mac Nessa who bore her name. Additionally, it tells how the great hero C\u00fachulainn was conceived, grew up, courted the beautiful Emer, and mistakenly killed his only son. Lastly, the story explains how two pigkeepers who always quarreled with one another were reborn time and time again until they found themselves as two powerful bulls, the white Finnbennach and the brown Donn Cuailnge. The T\u00e1in is set up by a series of stories. One day, Medb, the queen of the western province of Connacht, was lying in bed next to her husband Ailill, when they decided to compare their wealth. Medb believed that she owned as much as, if not more than Ailill, but her husband disagreed. They then counted their wealth, and Ailill was proven to be right, owning one more bull than Medb. Worse still, the great White Bull which had been born in Medb's herds, had migrated to Ailill's. Since under Brehon law, Medb's status as a wife was based on her wealth relative to her husband's, she decided to bring her possessions to the same level as his. She discovered that an equal to the White Bull was in the province of Ulster, Cuailnge peninsula. Medb sent a message to D\u00e1ire mac Fiachna, the lord of that region, offering a large amount of gold and her own thighs in return for the loan of the bull for one year. She hoped that a powerful bull-calf would be born by the great brown Donn from one of her cows. Though D\u00e1ire was willing to lend her the bull, he withdrew his consent after hearing Medb's raiders boasting of stealing the bull, rather than renting it. Furious, he changed his mind. However, Medb set out to steal the bull despite this setback. She had an advantage. The warriors of Ulster were cursed by Macha causing them to become frail and endure severe pain, similar to that of childbirth, whenever they were attacked. For four days and five nights, they suffered this weakness, allowing Medb's army to seize D\u00e1ire's fields and the bull. Medb then summoned a large army to Cruachan and prepared to launch her raid on Ulster. Among the warriors who answered her call was Fedelm, a bard or Druid who had the Imbas Forosnai, the gift of foresight. When Medb questioned Fedelm about the outcome of her raid, the seeress responded with a warning of crimson and red. However, Medb chose to disregard the warning and proceed with the attack. Ailill and Fergus mac R\u00f3ich, Medb's lover and former king of Ulster, also accompanied the army. Despite cattle-raiding being a summer activity, the army set out after Samhain during the off-season, catching their opponents off guard. Fergus was motivated to join the raid due to his discontent with Concobar for preventing him from gaining the throne of Ulster and for manipulating him into causing the deaths of the sons of Uisneach. A march through a land unguarded seemed like a peaceful journey with victory as the only outcome. This idea did not take into account the opposition of C\u00fachulainn, who was unaffected by the weakness of the Ulstermen and was willing to fight anyone who challenged him. C\u00fachulainn hung a warning on a tree, inviting any warrior who dared to engage in combat. Several warriors stepped forward to fight against him, but one after another, they met their demise, including Fr\u00e1ech, Medb's sons Maine and Orl\u00e1m, and Ferdiad, C\u00fachulainn's childhood friend. Although the great goddess M\u00f3rr\u00edgan joined in the fight to help Medb, it was not enough to stop the bloodshed. In the meantime, when C\u00fachulainn was busy with the incoming warriors, Medb took the brown Donn and fled. But when the Ulstermen recovered from their curse, they defeated Medb's army and won the battle, although they lost the most critical prize: the brown Donn. Medb brought it back to Connacht with her army. The two reincarnated swineherds, the white bull Finnbennach and the great brown Donn Cuailnge, fought as they had in the past, with the brown fatally wounding the white and then dying. This was the ending of the T\u00e1in, although the tale was later added of how the epic was lost and then partially restored by Seanch\u00e1n Toirp\u00e9ist, the son of Ireland's chief bard, who retrieved the ghost of the great warrior Fergus at his grave. Having taken part in the raid, Fergus was a reliable source for the lost material. During the recitation of the lost tale, the poet who had performed the invocation spotted the ghost of Fergus in the king's court and was scared to death upon the tale's completion."
