    "text": "The Scottish Banshee was known by the Highland names of Caointeach (or Caoineag), which meant \"wailer\" and \"weeper,\" respectively. This mythical being could be heard crying out when death was approaching. Caointeach would sit by a waterfall and wail before any death, but her crying would become particularly intense when disaster was imminent. As an example, the Caointeach of the Macdonalds mourned for days before the terrible massacre at Glencoe. At times, Caointeach was also believed to be washing the clothes of those who were doomed to die at night, much like the Washer At The Ford. Despite the despair her presence caused, the Caointeach was not malevolent, and was known to be deeply moved by human grief, which only caused her to weep even more copiously. These Fairy-like entities were generally not acknowledged, and it was believed that they should not be rewarded for performing their duties. Otherwise, they would vanish, leaving the family without a warning of imminent death. The Welsh version of this creature was known as the Cyhyreath, whose cries were said to replicate the sighs and groans of the dying."
