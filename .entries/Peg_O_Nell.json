    "text": "Peg O\u2019Nell is a popular mythological character in British folklore. As with other legendary beings, Peg O\u2019Nell is believed to be a former deity in a diminished form. In Lancashire, she is associated with the River Ribble, which, in the past, was known as the River goddess Belisama\u2019s dwelling. The goddess was respected at the source of the river as well as on its banks. Some scholars propose that her worship consisted of Human Sacrifice, with Peg O\u2019Nell as a remnant of the evil ritual. Peg was reportedly a housemaid who drowned in the Ribble. Every seven years, she would come back to take another life to punish those who failed to save her. In Ireland, \u00c1ine, a fairy queen and an ancestral goddess of the haunted Lough Gur, is tied to a similar drowning cycle occurring every seven years. To pay tribute to the river spirit on Peg\u2019s Night, when the Ribble would swell to capture a new victim, small animals or birds were sacrifices. A decapitated stone statue on the banks of the river at Waddow Hall is believed to be that of Peg. Alternatively, the statue could represent the goddess Belisama."
