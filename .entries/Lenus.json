    "text": "A Celtic god known as Lenus was worshipped both on the continent and in the British Isles. Specifically, the Treveri tribe considered him to be their ancestral deity. Statues of Lenus portray him standing alongside a notable bird - rumored to be a goose - which could symbolize his own abilities, or the fact that he was coupled with a goddess associated with these birds."
