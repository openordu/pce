    "text": "Molling, an Irish legendary figure believed to have lived in the seventh century C.E, holds a significant place in Celtic legends of Fionn Mac Cumhaill, who is considered to be Molling\u2019s foster brother. Goban Saor, the magical smith, is said to have constructed the saint\u2019s church from sacred trees known for their mystical properties. Interestingly, it was at Molling\u2019s church that king Suibhne breathed his last breath after experiencing madness for an extended period. This blending of mythological motifs with historical characters was a recurring practice to enhance their sacred powers."
