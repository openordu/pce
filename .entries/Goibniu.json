    "text": "One of the three craft gods of the tribe of goddess Danu, Goibniu, known by various names such as Goibne, Gaibnenn or Gobnenn, was an Irish god and the Smith of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. In the event of the depletion of the ruling king Nuada's arm in battle, Goibniu with the help of Dian C\u00e9cht, the god of healing, crafted a silver arm that was so perfect that it began working like a real arm once attached to the stump. Consequently, Nuada of the Silver Arm, who seemed unblemished, was not regarded as one, and he was forced to give up his rulership to half-Fomorian Bres mac Elatha, who was stingy and evil. However, he was shortly driven out of the throne, resolving the situation of ruling the tribe when the masterful physician and magician Miach chanted songs that grew skin over Nuada's silver arm, making him whole once again. With the silver arm, Nuada was then able to lead the Tuatha D\u00e9 to triumph in the second battle of Mag Tuired, thereby establishing their dominion in Ireland. While Ruad\u00e1n, Bres and Brigit's son, was spying to steal Goibniu's magical secrets before the battle, Goibniu killed him, which led to his mother inventing the wild sound of Keening to express her grief. Goibniu, to heal his wounds, visited the sacred Well on Slane hill. In ancient Ireland, every smith was believed to be a magical figure who transformed raw stones into metals and ultimately crafted them into useful objects such as weapons and ornaments. The mythological character Goibniu holds a high reputation that extends into the mythological sphere. Goibniu is sometimes referred to as the owner of Glas Ghaibhleann or the \"Cow of Abundance\". Goibniu was believed to have lived in Co. Cavan, where the Iron Mountains suggest an early mining industry. The myth surrounding Goibniu emphasizes abundance, where he was said to have had a Cauldron that allowed his guests to endlessly drink and stay young and healthy instead of becoming intoxicated. In folklore, Goibniu is recognized as Goban Saor, a sharp and intelligent smith that appears in many tales."
