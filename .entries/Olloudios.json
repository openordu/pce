    "text": "The deity Olloudios (also known as Ollouidias or Olludio) was part of the Continental Celtic and British pantheon. Despite being a relatively unknown Gaulish god, he may have been a local divinity (Genius Loci) revered in a Tree. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that his name appears to derive from two words indicating a \"great tree\" or \"giant tree\" (ollo-vidio). Olloudios' worship was concentrated on the islands off the south of France known as the Antibes, where the Narbonenses tribe venerated him. Records show that Olloudios was also present in Britain, particularly in Gloucester, where he was depicted with protruding ears resembling wings."
