    "text": "An Irish hero named Crunniuc (also known as Cronnchu or Crunnchu) was favored by the goddess (or Fairy Queen) Macha, who lived with him on his farm and brought prosperity and wealth to their land. Despite being pregnant, Macha failed to dissuade Crunniuc from attending the Assembly of Ulster, but she did manage to extract a promise from him not to speak of her to anyone, nor even refer to her existence. Crunniuc, however, broke his promise when he boasted that Macha was faster than the king\u2019s swiftest horses, which led to a race that Macha won. Sadly, Macha died giving birth to twins and cursed the entire region with Debility of the UlsterMen. There is no mention of Crunniuc after his wife's death, and it can be assumed that he was not looked upon favorably by others."
