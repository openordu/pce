    "text": "Water played a significant role in the myths of the Celts, particularly in Ireland and Scotland, where most Rivers were named after goddesses who were believed to nourish the land. Even streams and brooks held healing powers, though to a lesser extent. Sites where three streams met or crossed were considered to be particularly potent, as the Celts believed that anything happening in threes had great meaning. In Scotland, at such a site, if you cupped water from the point of meeting in your hands as the sun rose and recited the invocation \"I will wash my face, in the nine rays of the sun, as Mary washed her Son, in the rich fermented milk,\" you could expect good health and fortune."
