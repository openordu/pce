    "text": "Traditional healing encompassed different methods that included using herbal remedies, spells, and rituals. While some of the ancient herbal remedies have been backed by contemporary biochemistry for their efficacy, other remedies have either not been tested or proven ineffective. Interestingly though, many of the modern drugs we use today actually come from plant sources such as aspirin which is derived from willow, a plant of the Salix genus, and is known for its effectiveness in countering pain. In Scotland, St. John's Wort (Hypericum pulchrum) was believed to deter Fairies who would abduct people from their beds - this provides evidence that depression may have been earlier referred to as Fairy Kidnapping. Besides, various other forms of healing required magical practices, like attaching trailing pearlwort (Sagina procumbens) to the skins of people and animals to ward off the evil eye. Nonetheless, such superstitious rituals too, may have resulted in healing as modern medicine recognizes the placebo effect where people who are administered sugar pills may exhibit improvements similar to those on actual medications. Scientists today continue to ascertain the association between the body, mind, and spirit. In Ireland, holy well water was either sprinkled on or given to sick animals and people for healing, while in Scotland, reciting spells assisted in healing minor injuries and ailments like sprains and boils. Different regions also practiced specific healing rituals which often involved making trips to places revered by pre-Celtic people like springs and stone circles. Some of these places, like thermal springs, may have alleviated the pain of arthritis, but the ensuing biological effect of most sites cannot be established. Specific rituals were sometimes necessary when gathering herbs, involving the use of non-iron cutting tools, collection during certain hours of the day, and being rewarded with wine. Though many healing techniques were commonly used by the general public, there were instances where village herbalists or Witches were sought out for their expertise. These individuals were typically elderly women who made a modest living by offering advice to their community when necessary. However, their abilities had the potential to cause harm and could lead to accusations of Witchcraft if suspected of using their powers for negative purposes."
