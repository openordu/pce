    "text": "Welsh and Irish literary form known as the Triads holds significant mystic importance of the number Three. To aid memorization while providing a standard formula, numerous short poems were composed by poets and other Bards, which listed three examples of qualities, people, and places. The Triads include lists such as the Three Splendid Women of King Arthur's court, the Three Sorrows of Ireland, and many other groups. Scholars analyze these triads for encoded mythological material."
