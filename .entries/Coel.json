    "text": "British god Coel (also known as Coel Hen) is often mentioned in the popular nursery rhyme \"Old King Cole was a merry old soul.\" However, it's important to note that Coel was never actually a king, but rather an ancient Celtic deity known as \"old Coel,\" who over time was demoted or discredited to the status of a human being. Despite this, his name persisted and is seen in the town of Colchester."
