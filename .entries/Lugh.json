    "text": "Irish mythology depicts Lugh (or Lug, Luga, Lui Lavada, Lugh L\u00e1mfhoda, Lugh Samild\u00e1nach) as a prominent heroic figure. He was the descendant of the ominous Fomorian king Balor, renowned for his Evil Eye. Balor was warned by a prophet about his death by his grandson, so he kept his daughter, Lugh's mother Eithne, captive in a tower, hoping to prevent her from seeing any man and bearing a child. Nevertheless, Cian, Lugh's father, foiled the plan, disguising himself as a woman to enter the tower and impregnate Eithne. Although Eithne gave birth to triplet sons, Lugh was the only survivor. Lugh eventually fulfilled the prophecy by slaying his grandfather. He was raised among the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann and fought on their side in the mythical second battle of Mag Tuired.\n\nThe Book of Invasions has a different account, stating that Lugh was the son of the Dagda, the great fertility god of Ireland. When Lugh arrived at Tara, he asked the king to accept him into the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, claiming that he had already been fostered by one of their own, the sea god Manann\u00e1n Mac Lir. However, the Tuatha D\u00e9 were initially reluctant to allow him in, as they already had a skilled carpenter and a talented smith among them. Lugh then impressed them by declaring that he was both a master carpenter and an accomplished smith, earning him the title of \"many-skilled.\" A common motif of Irish mythology is that Lugh was not a single god, but a member of a group of multiple gods. Beneath the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann at Tara, the Bard, harper, historian, hero, and magician already dwelt. Lugh asked whether they possessed someone skilled in all these things, and the gods were forced to concede that they did not. Thus, Lugh was permitted to join them and became Samildanch, \"the one of many skills.\" Lugh's second title, L\u00e1mfhoda, \"of the long arms,\" was bestowed not because his arms trailed on the ground but because his weaponry expanded his reach beyond that of other warriors. Thanks to his proficiency with the javelin and sling, Lugh was a formidable opponent. When he battled his grandfather Balor, Balor realized the extent of Lugh's power. Although Lugh is mainly remembered as a harvest god, the fact that the battle with Balor was among a cycle of myth that may have portrayed a seasonal shift is what is apparent because Lugh led the Tuatha D\u00e9 against the Fomorians in a decisive confrontation; after securing victory, he spared the life of the half-Fomorian king Bres in exchange for agricultural knowledge. This is another instance of a connection between Lugh and the seasonal cycle that results in the harvest. Lugh is linked to other Celtic gods such as Lleu Llaw Gyffes in Wales and Lugos in Gaul as explained by some sources. His name is tied to the Celtic term lugio, which means \"oath,\" as Lugh supervised promise keeping. Lugh is best known as the god of the crafts and arts. While his facial luminosity led some to portray Lugh as a solar divinity, others argue that his name is based on the Latin word for light, lux. After the Celts had migrated to Ireland, Lugh may have arrived from the Continent, and the story of his coming to Tara could be a mythical memory of his assimilation into the gods of the land. Irish mythology is suffused with Lugh\u2019s heritage, as he was the father of C\u00fachulainn, the greatest hero of Ulster, born to the human woman Dechtire. During the great T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge, Lugh fought beside his son. However, as the Celtic influence in Ireland diminished, so did Lugh\u2019s reputation. During a Druid's Fog, Lugh prophesied the future of Conn of the Hundred Battles, king of Tara. Following this, Lugh vanished from Ireland. Some believe that he subsequently assumed the guise of the legendary craftsman, the Leprechaun, whose name means \u201clittle stooping Lugh.\u201d"
