    "text": "Irish mythological site known as Tir na mBan (Tir na Ban) was referred to as the Land of Women in the Irish Otherworld. It was a popular belief that this term applied to the enigmatic floating islands where Fairy Queens such as Niamh of the Golden Hair ruled. These islands gained fame for their fairy abductions that were frequently launched from their coasts."
