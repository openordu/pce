    "text": "A mythological race known as the Fomorians (also Fomoire, Fomh\u00f3ire, Fomor\u00e9) play a significant role in Ireland's history. These monsters, in Ireland's mythological past, were known to attack and fight against various settlers until they were defeated by the magical Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. As scholars widely agree that Ireland's settlement myths mentioned in the Book of Invasion and other texts have historical roots, the question arises as to who these demonic beings truly were. Initial descriptions of them representing one-legged and one-armed beings, for instance, are unlikely to be a factual representation of these beings. While earlier interpretations suggested that they were sea monsters or pirates, historical etymology today discredits such views since the mor in their names refers to the word \"phantom\" rather than \"sea.\" A more common approach is to interpret them as the remnants of ancient divinities who were subjugated in early invasions and subsequently intermingled and intermarried with their conquerors. While earlier narratives did not differentiate one Fomorian from another, later mythological texts portrayed them individually. They were found to be on par with the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, frequently intermarrying among themselves. For instance, Elatha, a Fomorian king, became the husband of \u00c9riu, the Tuatha D\u00e9 goddess, after whom Ireland is named. Bres Mac Elatha, their son, was the king at Tara for a brief period. Even the half-breed Lugh was related to the evil Fomorian king Balor through his daughter, Eithne, who was renowned for her beauty. Alliances between the Tuatha D\u00e9 and the Fomorians were not firm. Eventually, in the second battle of Mag Tuired, which is considered to be the most significant battle in Irish mythology, the Tuatha D\u00e9 squared off against the Fomorians. During the battle, Lugh killed his grandfather Balor and the Fomorians were banished permanently from the island and forced into the sea."
