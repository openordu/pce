    "text": "The focal point of the Welsh narrative of Kulhwch And Olwen is the Welsh heroine or goddess named Olwen. She is believed to have descended from an earlier goddess and there is evidence to suggest that she was a Sun goddess originally. Olwen's name, which means \u201cleaving white footprints\u201d or \u201cgolden wheel\u201d, her red-gold necklace and numerous golden rings, her flowing yellow hair, and her ability to produce white flowers with each step all strongly indicate her connection with the Sun. Kulhwch, the hero of the tale, sought to marry her. However, her father, Yspaddaden Penkawr (\u201cgiant hawthorn tree\u201d), refused to permit the match as he believed it would prove to be his downfall. (This is an analogous theme to the story of Balor of the Evil Eye, his daughter Eithne, and Cian, the hero who sought to court Eithne in the seemingly comparable Irish narrative.) Yspaddaden placed 13 obstacles (which are thought to possibly represent the 13 lunar months) in Kulhwch\u2019s path. But with Olwen's aid, the hero overcame these obstacles and won her hand in marriage."
