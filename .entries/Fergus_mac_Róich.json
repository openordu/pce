    "text": "A remarkable hero by the name of Fergus mac R\u00f3ich (mac Roech, mac Roth, MacRoy) was famed for his prowess. He was crowned king of Ulster, the land most synonymous with the noble name of Fergus, and subsequently wed Nessa, the Warrior Woman who gave birth to his son, Concobar Mac Nessa. Nessa agreed to marry Fergus on the condition that her offspring would become a royal heir. Fergus concurred, but upon completion of a year, Nessa conspired with his nobles to prevent his return to the throne. Fergus left Ulster to gather allies at Tara, but Concobar valiantly resisted the army, maintaining his position as the ruler. Although Fergus established peace with his usurper, Concobar's deceit turned him into an adversary. When the fated beauty, Deirdre, was born, a prophecy predicted that her beauty would lead to the land's ruin. Despite his Druids' advice that the infant be slain to prevent bloodshed, Concobar refused and instead sent Deirdre away to be raised to womanhood. Concobar had designs on Deirdre, but she had other plans and fled with her lover to Scotland. Later on, Fergus promised them safe passage back to Ireland but just as he left the court, Concobar had No\u00edsiu killed and took Deirdre for himself. In the end, Deirdre elected a life without her love and chose her own death over Concobar. Furious that Concobar had tarnished his honor with a deceitful plot, Fergus led his band of warriors to raid and burn down the royal court at Emain Macha. Archaeological evidence from prehistoric times does show a massive fire at Emain Macha, supporting this account. Fergus traveled west with his men to the court of Queen Medb at Cruachan, which was comparable to Emain Macha in the west. Various texts suggest that Fergus and Medb became lovers, as they were equally lustful. Fergus was renowned for his sexual prowess, and the Lia F\u00e1il, a seven-foot-tall stone pillar in Tara, was also known as Bod Fhearghais, or \"Fergus's phallus.\" His last name suggests that his father might have been a stallion, a fitting heritage for such a well-endowed hero. Some believe that Fergus may have fathered a son named Ciar, who gave his moniker to Co. Kerry in southwest Ireland. Fergus served Medb ably in the Cattle Raid recounted in the Irish myth T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge, and he used his colossal sword, Caladbolg, to slay hundreds of his former countrymen. He could have even murdered his foe, Concobar, had not the king's son thwarted him. The mighty epic that tells this story was in danger of being lost when Ireland's poets struggled after the Celtic kings lost their sovereignty. However, using an ancient formula for summoning spirits, several bards called forth Fergus's ghost from his grave and he recited the entire tale, preserving it for future generations to read. Fergus ended up in that grave as a result of his relationship with Medb. Fergus had an affair or was married to the woodland goddess Flidais, indicating that he might have been a god, possibly like the horned god Cernunnos of the continent. Although Ailill mac M\u00e1ta, Medb's husband, was commended for his lack of jealousy, he made a bitter comment after seeing his wife and Fergus engaging in nude frolicking at either Lough Carrowmore in Co. Mayo or a lake close to Carrickfergus in Co. Antrim. Fergus was killed by Ailill's loyal friend, the warrior-poet Lugaidh, who pretended to have mistaken Fergus for a stag; this could reveal that Fergus was originally a god."
