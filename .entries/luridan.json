    "text": "A figure of Scottish folklore, the luridan was first recorded in 1665 as a Brownie-like fairy who worked on farms in the Scottish islands. However, he was also associated with the ancient Celtic concept of the Genius Loci, or spirit of a place, as he was tied to specific locations, first in Wales and later on the island of Pomonia in the Orkney islands. Like other fairy creatures, the luridan was a diligent household helper who cleaned and washed dishes at night, and made sure the fire was lit early so the family woke up to a warm house."
