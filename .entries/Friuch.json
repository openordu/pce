    "text": "The tale of Friuch, an Irish hero, is one of great rivalry and reincarnation. He was the swineherd for Bodb Derg, a supernatural magician, and held a deep animosity towards his competitor, Rucht, who tended to the swine for farmer Ochall Ochne. This enmity between them was so strong that each time one died, they would be reborn in a form matching the other\u2019s. Over many lifetimes, they fought in the air, on the land, and in the sea, inhabiting various animal and human bodies. Determined to finally end their feud, they both became the strongest bulls in Ireland, with Rucht transforming into the white-horned bull Finnbennac and Friuch becoming Donn Cuailnge, the brown bull. As expected, the two bulls engaged in a fierce battle, and both were ultimately slain. This story of unending reincarnation is an underlying theme in the legendary Irish epic, T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge."
