    "text": "A bird of prey, the eagle holds symbolic power as a comprehensive creature of alternative identities in Celtic mythology. While it was once plentiful, eagles are now rare in Celtic lands. The Celts primarily used eagles to indicate comprehensiveness in a list of a mythological figure\u2019s alternative identities. For example, a one-eyed Salmon of wisdom in Ireland occasionally appeared as Fintan, an ancient invader who shape-shifted into many forms, including the eagle. In British legend, Henwen, a magical Pig, gave birth to eaglets as well as bees and wolves. Lleu Llaw Gyffes, the Welsh hero, was solely identified with the eagle, taking its form after being treacherously murdered by his wife. The eagle\u2019s appearance was sometimes associated with Oracles, and its presence could also be interpreted as an omen of things to come. The eagle could also be a form worn by a Shape-Shifting magician or Bard. Beyond mythology, eagles could hold the power of divination as a folkloric vestige of beliefs, particularly in Wales. Eagles who resided on Mount Snowdon were believed to be oracular and had the ability to control the weather. It was also believed that those whose ancestors had eaten eagle flesh possessed extraordinary psychic powers, up until the ninth generation."
