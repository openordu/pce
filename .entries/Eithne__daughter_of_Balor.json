    "text": "Balor, the ruler of the monstrous Fomorians, had a daughter named Eithne (also known as Eri), who was the mother of Lugh, a heroic figure. There are various versions of the story of Eithne's conception. An older one relates that Balor received a prophecy that his daughter's child would be the one to kill him. To prevent this from happening, he confined her in a tower in his distant kingdom on Tory Island, situated off the northwest coast of Ireland, and assumed that a girl who never sees a man would not be able to conceive. However, the prophecy came true in a way that Balor could not have imagined, and it led to his downfall. Balor coveted the Glas Ghaibhleann, a magical cow that lived on the mainland under the care of a human named Cian, and he stole it. But Cian refused to let the magical being go without a fight. He disguised himself as a woman and, with the help of a female druid named Bir\u00f3g, entered the tower where Eithne was kept and stayed with her until she gave birth to triplets, including Lugh. Balor was still trying to outsmart the prophecy, so he threw the babies into the sea. Lugh managed to survive and later killed his grandfather in the second battle of Mag Tuired, one of Ireland's most renowned mythological battles. The story has several variations; one of them refers to Cian as MacInelly; another names Dian C\u00e9cht, the physician god, as Eithne's lover and Lugh's father; another mentions Mac Cennfaelaid, the brother of the cow's owner, Gaibhl\u00edn, as Eithne's lover, and claims that he fathered the Seal-people with Eithne's twelve handmaidens; yet another recounts that Eithne, offered as a token of friendship from her Fomorian people to their enemies, the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, became the wife of their king Nuada, and thus the ancestor of the heroic figure Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Early evidences have been found by some scholars regarding Eithne, suggesting she was a virginal goddess who was nourished by a sacred cow's milk and was safeguarded from male intimacy by demons. This hypothetical figure is believed to have degenerated into the Eithne of folklore. However, a late anecdote details Eithne's excursion from the Otherworld and encounter with St. Patrick, leading to her demise two weeks following the event. This tale appears to blur the boundaries between the divine Eithne and the semi-historical princess (discussed below)."
