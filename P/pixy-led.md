Folkloric motif referred to as "pixy-led" or "pouk-ledden" is commonly found in the belief in Fairies, specifically in the ancient Celtic lands. The tale speaks of how these Fairies would lead humans astray by casting a spell or "Glamour" over the surrounding area, causing everything to seem unfamiliar and strange. They would cause paths to disappear, gates to vanish and roads to dissolve, but they themselves remained in the physical world. This would cause the pixy-led traveler to desperately search for a familiar landmark, but until the pixy released the spell, it would be to no avail. Being led by pixies was most common during liminal periods and places, such as at dusk, in Bogs, at lakeshores, and during ancient Celtic feasts, specifically Samhain on November 1. Shakespeare demonstrated an understanding of the superstitions surrounding pixy-led travelers through his description of Puck's antics in A Midsummer Nightâ€™s Dream. Recorded antidotes to breaking the pixy-led spell included carrying iron, wearing clothing backward or inside out, wearing hobnailed boots, carrying salt in the pocket or whistling or singing while walking. Although none of these actions offered a guaranteed solution, they provided some protection against said fairy mischief. For further information, refer to Stray Sod.
