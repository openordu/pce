The concept of the portals to the Otherworld held by the Celts involved a cosmology in which the Otherworld was not perceived as a separate place, being neither a heaven above nor a hell below. In fact, the Celts believed that the Otherworld existed in a sort of parallel realm that was situated close to this world; nevertheless, it was not possible to access it easily. However, specific places and moments in time provided opportunities to open portals to the Otherworld. A number of ancient sites, both of Celtic and pre-Celtic origin, were regarded as entryways, especially dolmens - ancient door-like structures built from stone by pre-Celtic people for unknown purposes. Similarly, pre-Celtic stone circles served as other portals, as did Celtic hillforts. Certain times of year also facilitated access to the Otherworld, with the two most significant being the Celtic holidays of Beltane and Samhain, which took place on May 1 and November 1 respectively. During these dates, the veil between the worlds became rather thin, and thus, easy to pass through, allowing beings to travel between either world with ease.
