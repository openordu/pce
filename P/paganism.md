Celtic religion is of pagan origin, meaning it is a polytheistic interpretation of the world as opposed to monotheism. The emergence of Celtic religion predated the birth of Christ, and therefore, its adherents were not yet exposed to the views of those who followed his teachings. Christian influence eventually led to the use of disparaging language against those who clung to their ancestral beliefs. These people were derogatorily referred to as "pagans." The word "pagan" has its roots in the Latin term "pagani," which referred to rural dwellers. The term "heathen" was used similarly as it was associated with poor agricultural land where people clung stubbornly to their traditional beliefs. These words carried negative connotations that continue to this day. Currently, the term "pagan" is used by some Americans to describe those who follow non-Christian spiritual traditions. The term Neo-Pagan distinguishes them from people who follow an unbroken tradition. In contrast, certain groups claim to practice ancient religions, frequently Celtic ones, passed down through secret means. While their assertions are often unfounded, folklore and place-lore like Dindshenchas have succeeded in transmitting ancient beliefs into contemporary times.
