Arthurian legends feature the Perilous Seat, a location akin to the Celtic Inauguration Stones. It honors genuine heroism, allowing only the adventurer who discovers the Grail to occupy it without vanishing. As some accounts shows, Percival attempted to sit on the Perilous Seat after initially failing to assist the Fisher King. The seat shattered to pieces, indicating his lack of worthiness at the time. Nevertheless, he restored the stone and sat upon it after successfully unearthing the Grail.
