Peredur is a remarkable hero in Welsh and Arthurian tales. Without any prior experience, he overcame various trials and accomplished numerous achievements, eventually becoming a respected and honorable knight. Interestingly, the character of Peredur underwent some changes, eventually serving as the inspiration for the Arthurian hero, Percival. Perhaps the name Peredur even echoes the idea of the Grail, as "per" roughly means "bowl" in the Brythonic Celtic language; it should be noted, however, that most versions of the Peredur story make no mention of the Grail.
