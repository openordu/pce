In Brittany's legendary Broc√©liande forest lies a treacherous valley known as the Perilous Valley, where Morgan, the half-sister of King Arthur and the unfaithful Guyomard's lover, cast a curse. Seeking to ease her hurt, Morgan ensorcelled the valley so that any man who had wronged a woman would become lost, trapped in the valley's confines, and unable to find a way out. The lush greenery would appear to be teeming with all manner of monsters to someone like Guyomard, who had been unfaithful. In the center of the valley stands the Fairy's Mirror, a lake from which horrific nightmares emerge like mist. Even though several knights entered the valley, each believed they were entirely alone. Eventually, Gawain, one of Arthur's knights, became ensnared in Morgan's trap, and Lancelot made a bid to rescue him. Since Lancelot has never betrayed his beloved Guinevere (his adultery with Elaine of Corbenic, in which the hero Galahad was born, did not count because he was drunk and believed he was with Guinevere), he easily conquered the enchantment and liberated the prisoners.
