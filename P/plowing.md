A customary action that involves the act of plowing fields is not only essential to prepare the land for sowing in spring, but holds a symbolic significance that can be traced back to myths and legends. In many cases, plowing acts as indication of the settlement of new people in an alien land. As a result, different races of invaders in Ireland are often described as clearing out and plowing distinctive regions of the land. The task of plowing is typically carried out by gods or heroes, while goddesses are occasionally involved in inspiring the work. Crom Dubh, an agricultural deity, is also referred to as Soicin, meaning “little plow,” which suggests that he is a dual god associated with the seasons of spring and fall. The name Mac Cécht, the husband of the land goddess Fódla which means “unplowed land,” simply denotes “plowman," as with the name Airem, which appears in one of the legendary tales of Tara's mythical kings.
