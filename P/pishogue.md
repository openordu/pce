Irish folklore has a traditional belief known as pishogue (pis√©og, pistrog). Although still in use in modern Ireland, the term "pishogue" or "pishoguery" dismisses old customs and sometimes refers to fictitious stories which appear as folklore. The word originally referred to a bewitchment that was Otherworldly and caused a distortion of reality, also known as Glamour.
