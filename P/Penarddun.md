Penarddun, a Welsh heroine, was the daughter of the eminent goddess DÔN and the god of the sea or death, Beli. She was one of the spouses of King Llyr and is commonly known as the mother of Llyr's daughter Branwen, as well as his sons Brân The Blessed and Manawydan. However, according to some sources, another woman, Iweriadd, was the mother of the first two children. With another man named Eurosswyd, Penarddun had two sons, Nisien, who was gentle, and EFNisien, who was evil. All of Penarddun's children played significant roles in the legendary Welsh tales that were gathered in the Mabinogion. However, there are few tales about Penarddun herself, and she appears to be an ancestral figure.
