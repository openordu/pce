The Celts did not have an equivalent concept to the Eastern Mediterranean idea of Paradise as a pre-existing, idyllic world that was lost to humanity due to sin and can only be accessed by the elect after death. What they believed instead was in an Otherworld accessible during one's lifetime only under certain circumstances. However, reaching the Otherworld did not necessarily mean a desirable outcome, as beings such as Fairies and minor deities, who were its occupants, could detain people against their will and refuse to allow them to return. Nevertheless, the Otherworld was still a beautiful and fulfilling place even if lacking in fertility. Perhaps the familiarity with this pleasant Otherworld aided Celts in accepting the resembling Christian concept of Paradise. Although Christians were only provided with glimpses of the future world, they could neither enter nor leave it in their mortal bodies. As the Kingdom of God, Paradise had none of the ambiguity of the Celtic Otherworld. Thus, although Paradise and the Otherworld have some similarities on the surface level, their differences are substantial.
