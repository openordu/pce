The cóiced were four mythological divisions of Ireland, each with its special significance. Leinster located in the east was viewed as the province of commerce. Munster located in the southwest was regarded as the land of music and women. Connacht located in the west was known as the province of wisdom, while Ulster located in the north was the land of war and strife. Although these regions were well-established in mythology, it was challenging to conceive of them as political entities. This trend remains even today. Other than the four main regions, there was a mythical fifth province called Mide or Meath. It was even more intangible than the others and represented the central province of communication, instead of a distinct geographic region. Some centuries ago, the county of Meath was established, but the fifth province of Ireland remains elusive, as it was in prehistory. Cóiced is another related concept.
