The British folklore has a character named pixy (also spelled as pigsie or piskie) which pertains to the Otherworldly beings of Fairyland. This name was popularly used in the West Country region of England and Cornwall. Pixies, similar to other fairy beings, were shorter than humans and often wore Green or Red with pointed ears and red hair. They would squint due to their inability to tolerate daylight and preferred nighttime. In Cornwall, piskies were more wrinkled, older and shorter than British pixies. They were well-known for their mischievous behavior, which includes leading people astray (Pixy-Led) and disturbing the animals at night. Nonetheless, just like Brownies and other household spirits, they could also be accommodating and friendly, often providing help with household and farm duties. However, as with other magical creatures, admiration or tokens of appreciation should be avoided as it may anger the pixy or drive them away (Laying the Fairies).
