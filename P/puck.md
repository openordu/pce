A well-known mischievous spirit among British folklore is Puck. Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream depicts Puck or Robin Goodfellow, the most famous of the fairies in English literature, as a merry wanderer of the night. Pucks were infamous for their mischievousness and were considered a type of Pooka, a ghostly presence that caused trouble wherever it went. These small and good-natured creatures delighted in leading travelers astray, pushing furniture to cause others to trip and fall, and laughed at the chaos they created. Despite their mischievous demeanors, Pucks were not malicious and could sometimes be convinced to help with farm labor as long as no reward was offered. Robin Goodfellow, who is also known as Puck, was believed to be the love child of Oberon and a country girl, according to 17th-century British folklore. He was an average child until he was six and realized he could transform himself into different shapes. Robin used this to his advantage to become a kind of Robin Hood, causing mayhem for the wealthy while helping the poor. Many of these motifs can be linked back to the Celtic myth of Manannán Mac Lir, the half-human fairy king and sea god.
