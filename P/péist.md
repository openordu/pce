A figure in Irish folklore, the péist (also known as bruckee) is a monstrous serpent or reptile that features in various legends, often being subdued by St. Patrick. Typically associated with freshwater bodies, particularly lakes, the péist can only be defeated while submerged. Locally referred to as the OLLIPHEISt, these creatures are particularly prevalent in the Burren region of west Co. Clare, where one can find place-names like Poulnapeasta, which means “water dragon’s lair” or “péist-hole”. Near Corofin, a pool that changed color and had several funnel holes was believed to house a monster that was brown, hairy, and had big eyes.
