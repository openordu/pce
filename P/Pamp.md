An essential figure in Irish mythology is Pamp, also known as Pam, who is considered a hero. According to The Book of Invasions, Pamp is the father of Nemed. Consequently, he is an ancestor of the Nemedians, who were one of the first groups to invade Ireland. Scholars speculate that Pamp's name was a recent creation, inspired by the Latin name Pompeius.
