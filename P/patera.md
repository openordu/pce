Cosmological symbol, the patera is often seen in depictions of the continental Celtic goddess Epona, who holds it upright in her hands. In various contexts, the same object is held by a deity, offered by a human worshipper, filled with produce or left empty. While some interpretations identify it as an offering plate, others suggest it may be a small frame drum.
