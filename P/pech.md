A Scottish folkloric figure known as the pech (peht, pict) was identified in Lowland Scotland as a type of Otherworld creature. This name apparently originated from an ancient historical people known as the Picts. The pech, like most fairy races, had fair skin and red hair (see Red) and could be mistaken for humans except for their notably short stature. Despite being dwarfish, they were strong and nimble, forming lines to carry stones from quarries for building their castles. As with many Otherworldly creatures, the pechs shunned the sunlight and scurried to their abodes each dawn.
