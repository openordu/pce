Stone structures known as Passage Graves or Passage Tombs in Ireland, Britain, and Brittany provide archaeological evidence of a pre-Celtic civilization. These massive structures consist of a corridor formed by standing upright large boulders that lead to an inner chamber. They were usually covered with earth to form a mound, popularly called Fairy Mound, but erosion has left the stone structure visible in many cases. The Celts held superstitious beliefs about these impressive ruins motivated by hauntings. Owing to these legends, they are considered mythological sites and they form part of the lasting folklore of the Celtic lands, like many other monuments built during the Megalithic Civilization.
