A Welsh mythical object known as Prydwen was mentioned in some Welsh legends as a vessel that possessed magical properties. It was believed to have belonged to King Arthur and had the capability to navigate between the waters of this world and the Otherworld. The term was at times attributed to Arthur's shield as well.
