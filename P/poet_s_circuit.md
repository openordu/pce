The poet's circuit is a recurring theme in Irish mythology. After completing their training, ancient bards traveled across Ireland, connecting with fellow poets, sharing stories and poems, and engaging in poetic discussions. During one of these journeys, Liadan, a beautiful maiden, met her destined lover, Cuirithir. Despite his proposal, Liadan refused to abandon her travels.
