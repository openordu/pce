A figure of British folklore is Peg Powler, known as a haunting spirit with green hair on River Tees which spans across Durham and Yorkshire counties. Peg Powler may have originated from the ancient Celtic River goddess of the area. She reportedly wanders around, primarily on Sundays, tricking both young and old into drowning in the river. If someone dies in Tees, it is believed that Peg Powler had eaten them. “Peg Powler’s suds” is the term given when foam accumulates on the river waves, suggesting that she is doing her laundry. A white slick indicates that she is milking her cow, and it is referred to as “Peg Powler’s cream.”
