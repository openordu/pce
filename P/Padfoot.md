A strange and ominous creature known as Padfoot, which originated from English folklore, was spotted in Yorkshire. Its appearance resembled that of a donkey, but of smaller size, and it would often appear as an amorphous, shaggy ball with eyes or a white, furry dog. The creature could turn invisible as it pleased and would often roar or make noise to incite fear in travelers who unknowingly passed by its abode. It was imperative that one did not strike out at Padfoot, as doing so would give the monster power over them. For additional information on similar creatures, refer to Barguest.
