A motif in folklore is the concept of planxty. According to those who have heard it, the music of the Otherworld was far more beautiful than anything heard in our world. Turlough Oâ€™Carolan, an Irish harper who fell asleep on a Fairy Mound, coined the term planxty to describe the unique qualities of fairy music. Unlike our music, it was not as regularly timed nor as rhythmic, but its discordant dissonance and erratic rhythm delivered a hypnotic and saddening trance that conventional music could not. Musicians who heard music in remote, isolated places could rest assured that what they were hearing was not an earthly melody. The melodies were beautiful, but they were also challenging to recall. Even if a fiddler played it repeatedly, by the time they returned home, the melody had disappeared from memory. Following Fairy Music led to a certain way of life, but it was not easy to return to human life once you had heard it. In the Isle of Man, a farmer named Lonagher Lowey entered a hill to uncover the melodious sounds; there he found a whole town where a magnificent banquet was taking place. Lowey poured the wine he was offered rather than drinking it as eating or drinking anything in the Otherworld would have made it impossible for him to leave. He was one of the uncommon individuals who returned safely from the Otherworld, also known as FairyLAND.
