A series of ritualistic activities, known as the pattern (in Irish usage) or patron (in Brittany), are performed on a specific day at a designated site. Although these customs are viewed as Christian, they originate from a Celtic, or sometimes pre-Celtic, source. Many examples of such rituals exist, such as visiting holy wells at traditional ritualistic times, climbing mountains during Celtic holidays, or engaging in specific actions while traveling along a certain road or pathway. The pattern usually included circular walking, offerings given at designated locations, recitation of particular prayers, or consuming water from a well. In some cases, these actions could be performed at any time, while at other locations, they had to be completed on a specific day and time. These rituals, which continue to exist in modern times, are deemed Christian by practitioners; they may acknowledge pagan roots, but rarely do they express any concern about them.
