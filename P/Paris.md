A Continental Celtic hero known as Paris can be found in the Welsh mythological tale of Kulhwch And Olwen, where he is portrayed as the king of the region that now houses the French capital. However, most scholars reject the idea that this indicates the existence of an actual historical Celtic king named Paris. Instead, they suggest that the name of the city is likely derived from a local Celtic tribe known as the Parisi, who also inhabited the Yorkshire region of Britain. Yet another legend suggests that Paris received its name because it was a beautiful city and was therefore called par-Ys, meaning "likeYS," after the lost magical city of Brittany.
