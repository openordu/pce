A knight named Percival, also known as Perceval, Parsival, Parsifal, or Parzifal, is a hero in the Arthurian legends. He is the son of a Welsh princess named Herzeloyde and a warrior named Gahmuret. Percival was raised in a simple cottage, unaware of his noble lineage, and was known for his simplicity and purity as a knight. The Grail, which is the cup used by Jesus at his Last Supper and later brought to the Celtic lands by Joseph of Arimathea, is an important part of the Arthurian legends. The story of the Grail quest begins with Percival wandering in a barren land ruled by a wounded king, who could only fish from a boat. One night while dining with the king, Percival has a vision of a chalice and a bleeding lance but does not mention anything about it. The castle then disappears, leaving Percival alone in the woodland, wondering how the Fisher King and his lands could be saved. Percival returns to Arthur's court and sets off on a quest to find the Grail with the other knights of the Round Table. Each knight experiences a different quest that matches the needs of their soul. Eventually, Percival rediscovered the Grail Castle and asked the necessary questions, which restored the king to health and bloomed the land again. Percival then succeeded the Fisher King on the throne of the reborn land. In 1175 C.F., Chrétien de Troyes, a well-known Breton writer, introduced the character of Percival in his work titled "Perceval, ou Le Conte du Graal". The same character later appeared in Thomas Malory's "Morte d'Arthur" as Sir Percival, and in the Germanic adaptations, he was known as Parzifal, which ultimately formed part of Richard Wagner's operatic cycle.
