Arthurian legends recount a treacherous location called the Perilous Bed. This site was not discernible in the physical realm, but by magical means, it manifested in the presence of knights engaged in the pursuit of the holy Grail. At first glance, the Bed appeared cozy and comfortable; however, those who dared to rest on it soon discovered its malevolent nature. Sharp blades imperceptible to the human eye savagely cut into any person who laid on it. Only Gawain was brave enough to vanquish the dangerous object, thereby putting an end to the threat it posed.
