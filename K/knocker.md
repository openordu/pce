In Cornish folklore, the knockers (also known as knackers) were mysterious creatures that caused strange knockings to be heard on the walls of mineshafts. Although nobody ever appeared after the eerie rapping, it was believed that these invisible knockers were actually the ghosts of long-dead miners, still working hard at their job. While some speculate that they might have been Jewish miners, who did indeed work in the Cornish mines, it is more likely that they were Fairies. The knockers were known to be helpful rather than harmful, as their knocking would grow louder as miners approached a rich vein of ore. However, they tended to haunt only the rich mines where tin could be extracted, and they did not bother with mined-out tunnels. If one were to say rude things about them, these spirits could turn vindictive, as they did not appreciate disrespect.  As such, miners traditionally took care not to wear crosses or leave tools crossing each other when leaving work at night, both of which were disliked by the knockers. Although singing in mines was completely acceptable, knockers did not like whistling. While they could be found haunting wells and caves occasionally, their main focus was on mines, and their relationship with miners was quite strong. These creatures were known to be private and did not appreciate being spied upon. There's a story about a man named Barker who managed to eavesdrop on them and even learn their fairy language. The creatures were so annoyed at his presence that they planned to leave their fairy tools on his knee, causing him to suffer immense pain and stiffness. From then on, people referred to the phrase "stiff as Barker's knee" to describe stiffness.
