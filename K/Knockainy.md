Near the bewitching waters of Lough Gur in Co. Limerick lies the Irish mythological site of Knockainy, a low mountain surmounted by a solitary stone Cairn, known as the abode of the Fairy Queen, named Áine. Some readings suggest that Áine was initially the district goddess Anu or DAnu, who bore the gods known as the Tuatha Dé Danann. Some associate Áine as a Sun goddess due to the presence of "sun-Well", near Knockainy that goes by her name. Knockainy was of particular importance during the Midsummer festivals and the harvest celebration of Lughnasa on August 1. During the festivities, the bearers of clars or straw torches marched along with their cattle on the hill slopes, seeking protection from Áine. The original name of the mountain was Collkilla or "hazel-wood," and since Hazels marked the consecrated lands wherein knowledge could be gained, the ancient name also indicates the importance of Áine's hill.
