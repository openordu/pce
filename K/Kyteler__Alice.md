Alice Kyteler, a wealthy merchant from Kilkenny, is celebrated as an Irish heroine due to the fact that witch-burning hysteria was not prevalent in Ireland, unlike Europe, including England and Scotland. Petronilla, who was the maid to Alice, is the only known woman who was executed for witchcraft in Ireland. In 1324, Petronilla and 11 of Alice's friends and family members were accused of witchcraft and heresy by Bishop Richard Ledrede of Ossory. This was the first instance in which witchcraft was associated with heretical beliefs derived from non-Christian traditions. Following the accusations, Alice fled to England where she lived the remainder of her life without gaining any further historical mention.
