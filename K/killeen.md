Irish sacred place known as killeen can be found across Ireland, marked on maps and preserved against destruction. These small fields or groves were utilized as burial places for fetuses that were miscarried, as well as premature or unbaptized babies who were not permitted burial in Christian cemeteries. The grief-stricken parents left them in places considered sacred before the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, and few details about the original divinities are known. Mac Rígh Éireann, the hero of an orally transmitted story rich in Ireland's folklore, shot a Raven in winter. Enchanted by the contrast between its red blood and black feathers amidst the white snow, the King of Ireland's Son chose to pursue a woman with similar appearance, a motif reflected in the more literary story of Deirdre. He set off on a long quest and took care of a poor man's affairs, whose debts had almost resulted in his being denied burial had it not been for the king's son paid them off. His generosity earned him the dying man's gratitude, which later proved useful in his journey. Along the way, the king's son encountered several helpful aides. One was a Green Man who wished for a kiss from the intended bride, and another was a man blessed with ears so attuned he could hear grass growing. Several more servants arrived to aid the challenging tests set forth by the Giant who held the king’s son’s beloved hostage: one who breathed so strongly that he kept one finger firmly pressed to a nostril, a speedy runner with a tethered foot, and a mighty strongman. All proved to be valuable assets. Eventually, the princess was won and the little Green Man - who had aided the king’s son earlier in the story - demanded his reward of the first kiss. Additionally, he insisted that he be left alone with the princess to collect it. His requests were fulfilled, but dangerous Serpents soon appeared. If the Green Man had not been there to assist, they would have surely killed the king’s son and his newly-wedded bride. Thankfully, the Green Man was able to defeat the Serpents with ease. In the end, it was revealed that this helpful Green Man was actually a dead man whose debts had been paid by the king’s son. This fascinating tale is beloved by those who enjoy analyzing and categorizing folklore motifs.
