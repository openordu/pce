A site of Irish mythology, Kildare, receives its name from the words for "church" and "Oak". This town, located in the eastern Province of Leinster, holds together crucial symbols of Celtic and Christian spirituality. The sanctuary in Kildare is connected with Brigit, a Christian saint believed to have originated from a Celtic deity. The prevalent day in the province is February 1, the ancient Celtic festival of Imbolc. This day is still celebrated as Lá Féilé Bhríde, the day of Brigit.
