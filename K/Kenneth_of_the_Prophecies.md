Kenneth of the Prophecies, also known as Brahan Seer, Kenneth MacKenzie, Cainnech and Coinneach Odhar Fiosaiche, is a venerated Scottish hero. Similar to Nostradamus, this folk figure was said to possess supernatural powers that allowed him to predict the future. A reflection of the Celtic Bard, Kenneth MacKenzie is said to be a historical figure, although his story is infused with mythological elements. Legend has it that his mother, dozing near an ancient sacred site, had a vision of Ghosts who showed her a powerful blue Stone. She found the Stone and gave it to her son, who could see the future whenever he held it. Some accounts claim that Kenneth foresaw the tragedy of the Highland Clearances, when people were displaced from their lands in favor of profit-hungry landlords, while others assert that he predicted the dismantling of the ancient clan system. One unfulfilled prophecy foretells the destruction of Lewis and Harris in a great battle. Kenneth's magic blue stone allegedly still rests on the bottom of Lough Ussie following his death, in a manner similar to the drowned blue power-object of the parallel Irish figure, Biddy Early.
