The Arthurian tale of Kulhwch and Olwen, a Welsh story from the late 12th-century, explores both Celtic myth and the legends of Britain's quasi-mythological king, Arthur. Kulhwch, the hero of this story, was the son of a princely man named Cilydd and Goleuddydd, his wife, who lost her sanity after becoming pregnant. While in labor near a Pig shed, she gave birth to Kulhwch, who was named “pig-run.” Cilydd, Kulhwch's ambitious father, gained a new wife through murder after Goleuddydd's death. The new queen wished for Kulhwch to marry her daughter, but after he declined, she cursed him to never marry until he won the hand of the giant's daughter, Olwen. In another variation of the story, Kulhwch's mother, Gilydd, survived and encouraged her son to pursue his love for Olwen. Kulhwch hoped to win Olwen's hand with the help of his cousin Arthur, so he traveled to Camelot to recite his distinguished heritage and gain Arthur's aid. Kulhwch and Arthur set out with a team of warriors until they met Kulhwch's aunt, who warned them about the dangers of the giant's castle. Despite the warning, they approached the castle without fear. Kulhwch met Olwen there, and the two fell deeply in love. The hero, Kulhwch, was unwilling to leave the maiden's side without her father's blessing. However, the father's blessing could only be obtained if Kulhwch performed 40 seemingly impossible tasks. One task, for instance, was particularly daunting: Kulhwch had to capture a set of scissors, a razor, and a comb from a terrifying pig called Twrch Trwyth. As the tale progresses, Kulhwch completes all the tasks and ultimately wins the hand of his beloved Olwen. The text has captured the attention of many Celtic scholars as it straddles the middle ground between myth and legend, incorporating mythological motifs that are familiar from other Celtic lands, as well as heroic names and personalities. Several magical and Otherworldly characters and objects are skillfully interwoven into the narrative.
