The mythological site of Knockaulin (Cnoc Ailinne, Knockawlin) was once the royal seat of the kings of the eastern Province of Leinster. It served as an equivalent to Tara in the magical central province of Mide and Emain Macha in Ulster. Originally known as Dún Ailinne, recent excavations of the Celtic earthworks on the hill have supported the local legend about its significance. The low hill is located near Kilcullen in Co. Kildare and is often confused with the nearby Hill of Allen (see Almu), which was the seat of the great hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill.
