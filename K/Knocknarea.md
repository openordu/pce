Above the small town of Sligo in northwestern Ireland there is the site of Knocknarea (Cnoc na Ria) which is a mountain that was crowned approximately 6,000 years ago with a mound and a rock Cairn. Legend has it that the cairn, known as Miosgán Méabha or “Mebh’s lump,” covers the grave of Ireland's most famous queens, Medb of Cruachan. However, historical texts cite that Eógan Bél, the last pre-Christian king of Connacht, erected the cairn, and that Medb was killed many miles away, on the shores of Lough Ree on the River Shannon. Local tradition in Sligo stipulates that individuals ascending the mountain should carry a small stone or pebble with them to add to the cairn. Conversely, it is considered extremely unlucky to remove any stones from the cairn.
