The creation of fabric through the twisting of yarn using two needles was a significant and highly-valued craft in Celtic lands, particularly in Ireland and Scotland. Its origins are believed to have stemmed from the eastern Mediterranean, eventually finding their way to the European islands via trading routes. Once there, it quickly became a favored method of producing sturdy garments from sheep wool. Over time, specific designs and pattern combinations emerged - such as the Jersey, Guernsey, Aran, Shetland, and Fair Isle - which are still utilized today, though no longer limited to specific villages or regions. The image of a woman knitting became a common and potent symbol, with various folktales attributing magical or prophetic powers to her. For instance, the goddess Áine, or her stand-in the Fairy Housekeeper known as Toice Bhrean, were both said to reside below the mystical waves of Lough Gur while knitting.
