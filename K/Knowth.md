Two hundred seventy-four meters from the famous ancient site of Newgrange are two other mounds, Knowth and Dowth, situated on hills overlooking a bend in the River Boyne. Together called the Brú Na Bóinne, these sites are known as the palaces of Bóand, the river goddess. The great Knowth mound, along with its companions, was constructed over 6,000 years ago by an unnamed people who possessed remarkable engineering and astronomical abilities. The massive Cairn of Knowth was aligned towards the point of sunrise during the spring and fall Equinoxes. These two dates are crucial because they represent the times in the year when day and night are equal. For nearly three decades, Knowth, which is famous for having the most beautiful and expressive megalithic art in Europe, was under excavation. However, as of early 2002, it has opened to the public, providing viewers with the opportunity to admire its impressive rock carvings.
