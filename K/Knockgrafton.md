At the foot of the Galtee Mountains lies Knockgrafton, a site steeped in Irish mythology. Legend has it that on this mountain, in the Glen of Aherlow, a hunchback once overheard Fairies singing a monotonous tune that went, “Monday, Tuesday.” This quick-witted hunchback extended their song, much to their delight, and as a result, they cured his deformity. Such tales are not uncommon in Celtic lands.
