The Celts believed that the role of a king was an office that required responsibility and limitations, unlike our current image of a king as a man with absolute power. Upon entering into office, the king would be in a sacred marriage with the goddess of Sovereignty, with the queen possibly representing the goddess of the land. The land was fertile and the people were well-fed as long as the king lived righteously. If the king did not satisfy the goddess with his rectitude, the crops would fail and famine would loom throughout the land. The Celtic king’s role is sometimes regarded as sacral by some scholars who point out that it was not mainly about politics or military power, but rather a symbolic show of the king’s “the prince’s truth” or fírinne flatho through the performance of duties or Buada and taboos as in Geis. The seventh-century C.E. text indicates that the king should never act oppressively with force and should avoid wise supporters. Providing food and shelter for all who needed or desired it fell under the king’s responsibility of hospitality. Additionally, the king was bound by sacred vows that varied from region to region; for example, the king of Tara should never stay abed when the sun was up, while the king of Connacht was prohibited from wearing a gray-speckled robe while riding a gray-speckled horse to Cruachan. The king Math of mythology in Wales was never allowed to put his feet on the ground and instead was required to always keep them in the lap of a virgin. Although this rule may seem peculiar, it aligns with the taboos enforced upon monarchs in other lands, reminding them to constantly be aware of the responsibility of their office rather than living like common humans. There are various myths about the chaos that ensued from kings violating their geasa or failing to fulfill the duties of hospitality. For instance, King Bres was ousted from Tara's throne when he provided a poet with meager scraps, while King Conaire died a dreadful death in Da Derga's hostel after unknowingly violating the sacred vows of his office. This has led some scholars to postulate that the requirement of Irish kingship portrays the king as a sacrificial priest whose life may need to be sacrificed if his actions cause famine and disease. It is challenging to find sources illuminating the roles of Celtic kings outside Ireland, nor can it be discerned with certainty how the varying levels of kingship correlated with each other, or what the specific duties of each were. In Irish law, the kings of a tribe (rí tuaithe), the kings of multiple tribes (rí ruiri), the provincial kings (rí coícid), and finally, the High King (ard rí), were delineated. However, in ancient times, it seemed that the higher offices of provincial and High King played more significant roles in myth than in history. It was only during the Middle Ages that the role of the High King began to intersect with political and strategic goals.
