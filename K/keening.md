A pre-Christian rite present in Irish society despite the church’s objections is the keening ritual. According to legend, this ritual originated when the goddess Brigit invented it following the death of her son, Ruadán, in battle. Typically performed by women of the village who had a talent for producing sorrowful melodies, the ritual consisted of women screaming and clapping over the deceased body. Although usually performed by village women, wives and daughters also participated in keening. Its name originates from the Irish word "caoin".
