In Connacht, a fabled creature by the name of Kerhanagh (Kiraqhna) was revered as a monster that breathed fire. Legend has it that St. Patrick banished the creature from the sacred mountaintop named Croagh Patrick. This menacing demon traversed the land and polluted sacred Wells with its foul breath while Patrick, in pursuit, nearly lost its trail in Sligo. Eventually, however, the saint managed to strike a rock near Tullaghan with his staff, which resulted in sweet water gushing forth. Reinvigorated by fresh water, Patrick finally defeated the beast in battle. Myths of Patrick and his encounters with monsters have been interpreted distinctly as a symbol of Christian eradication of previous pagan practices; some interpret it as Patrick replacing an earlier mythological hero who drove away ominous spirits. The Kerhanagh may be the same entity as Corra and/or Caoranach, even though the legends are not identical. Interestingly, the Devil’s Mother is another name by which Kerhanagh is known in English.
