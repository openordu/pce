The oak tree was considered a symbolic plant among the Celts due to its numerous advantages. The oak was greatly valued for its practicality as it produced abundant acorns which were a preferred food for Pigs in ancient times, and their flesh became part of the human diet. Its wood was also highly sought after for building purposes, and its bark was useful for tanning leather. On the spiritual side, the oak was also significant. Pliny the Elder, a Roman author, noted that the Celts harvested Mistletoe from oak trees, which was then used for ritual purposes to cure diseases and promote human fertility. Oak forests were widespread in continental Gaul, where they were considered sacred. Evidence suggests that the tree was associated with the afterlife or Otherworld by the Hallstatt and La TÃˆNE peoples who constructed oak funeral houses. The oak may have been connected to a particular god though documentation only dates back to Roman times. Maximum Tyrius claimed that the oak symbolized the father of gods, who resided within the tree. In Gaulish temples, indoor Jupiter columns (Jupiter being the Roman equivalent of Zeus) may have been replacements for large trees dedicated to the god. While all trees were important to the Celts, the oak was held to be the most sacred tree by the Druids who formed the Celtic priesthood. The word "druid" is connected to an ancient word for "oak". Describing the druids, the Roman poet Lucan shared their usage of acorns in their rituals for prophecy, chewing them until they had visions. However, the account is difficult to believe as no hallucinogenic components have been found in acorns. During the pre-Roman and Roman periods, wooden images exist, carved using the durable wood of oak. The significance of the oak remained in the post-Celtic era, inspiring folk beliefs that viewed the oak as a living entity that would scream or harm the woodcutter who cut it down. Such beliefs include one imagining that the oak would make a deafening noise when cut down, audible from a distance of a mile. Folk beliefs hold that faeries inhabit or remain around oak trees. The oak forms one of three sacred trees, along with Ash and Thorn, that mark faerie places. Today, remnants of the importance of the oak in ancient Celtic life are still present in names that incorporate the tree, like 'Drunemeton' ('sacred oak grove'), the capital of the Galacians in Turkey and the Irish abbey towns of Kildare ('church of the oak') and Durrow ('plain of oaks').
