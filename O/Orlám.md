Irish hero, Orlám was born to queen Medb and king Ailill mac Máta of the western province of Connacht. During the Cattle Raid known as the Táin Bó Cuailnge, Orlám was one of the first to fall at the hands of the great hero Cúchulainn. Following Orlám's death, his charioteer brought his master's head to Medb and Ailill, but was met with a brutal end when Cúchulainn threw a stone at him.
