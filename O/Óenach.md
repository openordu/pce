The Irish ritual assembly known as the Óenach (or Aonach) was held regularly by the Celtic peoples of Ireland at holy locations for celebrating seasonal rituals to honor the natural cycle and revive the ancient union of the tribe. These assemblies, which were significant not only for religious purposes but also served other practical uses, took place since the ancient Irish lived in quite small and remote areas. They involved trading horses and cattle, young people meeting and courting, hiring laborers, and creating contracts between geographically separated parties. The most notable Óenachs were those that occurred at the holy hill Uisneach, located at the center of Ireland, during the time of Beltane, and at the site of the goddess Tailtiu, during Lughnasa.
