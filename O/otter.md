The otter has been regarded as a symbolic animal by both the Irish and the Scottish Highlanders, who believed that this sleek, playful water mammal had the powers of the Otherworld. It was believed to live in kingdoms similar to humans, ruled over by an otter king (sometimes called Dorraghow or Dobharchú) whose skin was worth a fortune. Despite the value of the pelt, the creature was virtually invulnerable and hard to catch. Only a bit of white fur under its chin could reveal the vulnerable spot where it could be killed. However, killing the king otter was considered costly, as the murderer (whether human or dog) would die soon after and was apparently taken out of revenge by the otter-people. Nevertheless, some people thought it was worth the risk, as a fragment of the hide was believed to protect an entire household from harm. Additionally, soldiers believed that they could be shielded from death at the front if they carried a portion of the skin of a king otter. According to tradition, only those carrying king-otter skin escaped the historic massacre of the followers of Bonnie Prince Charlie at Culloden. In Ireland, owning a purse made from the skin of the king otter guaranteed a lifetime of wealth as it would be forever filled with coins.
