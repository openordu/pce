Named after the brave heroine Odras, daughter (or wife) of the hostel-keeper Buchat Buasach, a lake in Co. Roscommon in Ireland's western province of Connacht serves as a reminder of her valiant efforts. The great deathqueen, the Mórrígan, had purloined Odras's cow to mate with her own Otherworld bull, Slemuin the Smooth. Despite possible recklessness, Odras pursued the thief and set her sights on Oweynagat, the cave beneath the great provincial capital Cruachan, hoping to retrieve her loss. There, an enchantment took hold of her, and she dozed off beneath an Oak tree, just before penetrating into the Mórrígan's domain. Ultimately, she never awoke, as the Mórrígan transformed her into the small lake now known by her name, ensuring she couldn't reclaim her stolen cow.
