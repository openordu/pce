The owl, a symbolic animal recognized for its majestic power, has been esteemed by people across the world. In Celtic mythology, the owl represents wisdom and age, with the most notable example being the transformed Welsh flower-bride Blodeuwedd, who was punished for betraying her husband and subsequently transformed into an owl. Another instance of an owl in Welsh literature is the Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd, though it was unable to provide the hero with the information he needed in the tale of Kulhwch And Olwen. Within Irish mythology, a vestigial owl goddess is referenced in the figure of Echtach, who is the sister or double of the cannibal goddess Eghchte. Additionally, some pre-Celtic monuments in Ireland, Britain, and France feature patterns that resemble eyes and have been interpreted by some as representative of an owl-faced goddess. While this viewpoint is controversial, it links these ancient monuments to others in the eastern and central Mediterranean.
