Amidst the mythological Irish settlers, the Fomorians, a monstrous breed, were known to instill fear in people due to their violent and fierce ways. They were typically perceived as a collective unit under the leadership of Balor of the Evil Eye. However, there was an exception in the form of a Fomorian named Octriallach. Octriallach, a spy, uncovered the secrets of the Fomorians' opponents - the Tuatha Dé Danann. The physician, Dian Cécht, of the Tuatha Dé, had created a magical Well of Slaine, which held the power to heal all their wounds, except for reconnecting amputated body parts. Octriallach, upon discovering this, filled the Well with earth, ultimately leading to his death by the hand of Ogma, the god of eloquence.
