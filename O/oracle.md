A symbolic object or event is often used as an oracle to predict the future in Divination systems. The outcome of events is foretold by various occurrences, such as flights of birds, unusual weather, and untimely blossoming. Oracles are usually objects or events that are out of place, such as a seashell found on a mountain or a tree blossoming in winter. Omens, which predict ill-fortune, are sometimes distinguished from oracles, which are neutral or positive in nature. The term "oracle" can also refer to a prophet; however, this usage is more commonly associated with classical culture, like the Oracle of Delphi in Greece, rather than Celtic culture.
