An animal that holds significant symbolic importance is the ox. Often mistaken for cattle, this term specifically refers to a neutered bull of the domestic bovine species. The reason for castrating these animals at an early age is to produce a more docile character, lessen the risk of bullfights in herds, and promote weight gain. Oxen were then utilized for their immense strength to aid in hauling heavy loads and even served as food. Although not as prominently featured in mythology as bulls or cows, they sometimes embody steadfastness and tenacity. Moreover, prestigious names were given to topographical sites based on oxen; in the western region of Ireland, there exist the spectacular Ox Mountains.
