A hero of both Scottish and Irish origin, Oscar (Osgar) was the son of the poet Oisín and his wife Eibhir, and grandson of the legendary warrior Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Following in his father’s footsteps, Oscar joined the Fianna, a group of valiant fighters who battled alongside Fionn. His name translates to “deer lover,” which pays tribute to his grandmother, Sadb, who was transformed into a deer through magic. Oscar, the fiercest of the Fianna warriors, led a group called “the terrible broom,” named for their ability to sweep any battlefield clean. After the death of his grandfather, Oscar became the leader of the mighty band. Tragically, they were defeated in the battle of Gabhra, and Oscar met his demise at the hands of wounds inflicted during the fight. Following his death, his father Oisín bore him to the Otherworld, causing Oscar’s wife Aidín to succumb to grief and weep herself to death.
