Archaeological site named Oppida pertains to the Latin lexicon to refer to ancient Celtic towns such as the one revealed at La Téne located in Switzerland. These towns, which arose from the sixth to the fifth century B.C.E., were characterized by their upraised fortified structures that were built in locations strategically defensible, such as high elevations or promontories. Frequently, the selection of the site was closely tied to easy access to valuable mineral deposits, which served as a primary source of riches for the inhabitants.
