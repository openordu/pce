The Celtic people did not utilize alphabetic letters or pictorial script to spell out words in their writing. Rather, religious, ritual, and historical material was committed to memory by the Druids. The Druids believed that this kind of material was too precious to be written down and thus at risk of coming into the possession of those who may not understand or appreciate its meaning and value. As a result, we have no written mythology, prayer books, or even historical works from the Celts themselves. It is important to note that any written sources regarding Celtic material may harbor political or religious biases. The Celt's lack of interest in or taboo against writing was rooted in the belief that spoken words held great power. Even in modern times, eloquent speech is held in high regard in ancient Celtic territories. Despite the absence of a widespread writing system, the Celts did have a symbolic script system called ogham. This system was said to have been invented by Ogma or Brigit, gods of eloquence and poetry, respectively. The ogham "letters" were created by drawing lines horizontally and diagonally on wood, with 20 different possible stroke combinations. It is unclear if ogham was inspired by contact with literate cultures or if it was a wholly original invention. Libraries consisting of wooden wands inscribed with such lines are referred to as epics; however, wood is not generally long-lasting. The inscriptions discovered until now, which amount to fewer than 400, are mainly carved on stone, and most of them contain only a single name or title. The ogham tablets are mostly from the province of Munster, situated in the southwest of Ireland. Some scholars argue that the script was invented during the period between the third and fourth centuries C.E. However, these tablets are also found in Wales and Scotland.
