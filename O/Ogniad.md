A figure named Ogniad, who is believed to be an Irish goddess or heroine, is shrouded in obscurity. She was the daughter of the significant Fairy king Midir and gave birth to the hero Sigmall. However, her character is known to be unruly and stubborn. It remains uncertain whether Étain, who was Midir's consort, was Ogniad's birth mother due to a lack of textual evidence.
