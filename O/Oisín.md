A legendary figure in Irish lore, Oisín (also known as Oshin, Ossian, and Oisin) was a poet of the Fianna, a group of warriors who served under the great hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Oisín earned the name "little fawn" due to the fur on his eyebrows, which remained after his mother Sadb licked him clean while in her enchanted Deer form. He became the most articulate among his peers and, like many other poets, caught the attention of a Fairy Lover. Niamh of the Golden Hair, the most stunning of all fairies, became Oisín's mistress, and she took him away from his human wife, the beautiful blonde Eibhir. Oisín accompanied Niamh to Tir Tairngiri, the magical land of promise beyond the western waves, where they lived together for several weeks. Or so the time seemed to Oisín, for time elapsed differently in FairyLAND than in the earthly world. Whilst Oisín was away, three centuries went by, during which his friends passed away, and Ireland transformed beyond recognition.

Oisín eventually grew homesick and asked Niamh to let him return to reality. She reluctantly permitted his departure and equipped him with a magic horse. She warned him never to touch the ground, a common folkloric motif, which often portends that someone will inevitably break the rule. Oisín returned home but tragically went against the Fairy Lover's warning by placing his feet on the ground. Multiple sources differ on the exact cause, as some say it was because his saddle failed, while others say it was due to his altruism towards a beggar or his overwhelming desire to feel the earthly terrain under his feet once more. Upon reaching the ground, Oisín's old age immediately caught up to him, stripping him of his health and vitality. Regardless of versions of the story, he ultimately passed away and returned to dust in the blink of an eye. Some renditions claim that he lived just long enough to converse with St. Patrick regarding Ireland's ancient paganism and to ultimately accept the Christian way and be baptized. Furthermore, the Scottish poet James Macpherson fabricated a character named Ossian and subsequently attributed several poems to him that he had written himself, inspired by the oral literature of his homeland. Although Macpherson's work was later denounced as sentimental due to the revelation that there was never an ancient Scottish poet named Ossian who had been translated, it still held significant influence, particularly in Germany, where it inspired the emergence of Romantic poets.
