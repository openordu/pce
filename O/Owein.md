Owein, also known as Owain, Iwein, Yvain, and Owein fab Urien, was a heroic figure in Arthurian tales. In an Arthurian text originating from Wales, namely The Dream of Rhonabwy, Owein was depicted as a knight of Camelot and the son of King Urien and King Arthur's sorceress half-sister, Morgan. While on an expedition, Owein encountered a land that was plagued by a mysterious Black Knight. He eventually found the Knight in a forest, Broc√©liande, and defeated him gallantly. In the same forest, Owein also discovered a fountain that was guarded by a beautiful maid called Luned. With Luned's assistance, he won the heart of her mistress, Lady of the Fountain. Owein pledged his loyalty to her, but his promise was short-lived, as he forgot to return to her while adventuring with King Arthur. Luned, Lady of the Fountain's servant, followed Owein to Camelot and publicly embarrassed him for his infidelity. He ran off into the forest and once again became a knight after healing from his injuries. While exploring the countryside, he ran into Luned again, and together, they defeated an imprisoning Giant. In gratitude, Luned facilitated a reconciliation between Owein and Lady of the Fountain.
