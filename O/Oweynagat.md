In Ireland’s western province of Connacht resides a minute yet significantly mythological site, known as Oweynagat or the Cave of Cruachan or the Cave of the Cats. It forms a crucial part of the vast archaeological complex of Cruachan - the ancient capital of the province. Centered around the fort of the goddess-queen Medb, the cave's opening, made by an underground medieval souterrain, is quite small, measuring three feet high by four feet wide. Precisely located to the southwest of Medb's palace and still evident in a tiny clearing on the periphery of the complex, the cave opens up to a vast cathedral-like space. The Irish myth and legend hold an essential place for Oweynagat, which served as Medb's birthplace. Long ago, the fairy queen and goddess Étain escaped from her mortal husband with her Fairy lover Midir, accompanied by her team, including her maidservant Crochan Crogderg, famously known as the "blood-red cup." Midir had a relative named Sinech or the "large-breasted one," residing in the cave, which he wanted to visit. The group stopped at the Cave of Cats during their journey, where Crochan became ardently attached to the place - a dingy cave that doubles as a great palace in the Otherworld. They granted the cave to Crochan, who gave birth to her daughter Medb. Besides, the Adventure tale includes Nera, Medb's servant, who saved Cruachan from Otherworldly forces with the help of a fairy woman he met in the cave and subsequently married. Medb's warning that her glorious palace would be burnt to the ground during Samhain brought together the forces of Ailill mac Máta and Medb into the cave to eliminate any potential danger. The cave is related to the Samhain celebration in a similar way to the other tales. In the epic story Táin Bó Cuailnge or Cattle Raid on Cuailnge, the Morrigán, who is a great figure that follows Medb throughout, is associated with the cave. She leads her Otherworldly cattle into the cave every evening, and shadows of her presence may appear during the magical Celtic festival of Samhain that falls on November 1st. The veil between the worlds becomes thin, and even people without Second Sight can see beyond this world and into the next. Oweynagat is believed to be the cave where the Morrigán drove Odras' cattle after stealing them. Despite Odras' attempts to recover her beloved cattle, she was no match for the Morrigán and was turned into a lake. The etymology of Oweynagat is unclear as cats have no connection to the cave's folklore or myth. However, some texts record the existence of a prophetic cave in Connacht where a cat was consulted by fortune-tellers. The location of this cave remains undisclosed, making it impossible to determine if Oweynagat is the cave referenced. Cattle are the animals most commonly linked to Oweynagat, rather than cats; it is reported that the Mórrígan drove her cattle through the cave, while legends speak of a woman travelling great distances underground while clinging to a calf's tail. In a text from the 18th century, the cave was referred to as the "Hell-mouth of Ireland," with implications that the cave's previously assumed spiritual occupants were still active, but in a devilish and demonic way. Despite being one of Ireland's most significant mythological sites, the cave remains one of the least-visited due to its disconcertingly small entrance which still provides access to the cave.
