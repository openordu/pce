A British folkloric character known as Oberon (also spelled Auberon and Oberycome) is significant in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Shakespeare portrays him as the Fairyland king who, quarrelling with his mistress Titania, intervenes in the romantic affairs of humans lost in the woods. Although he also appears in British and French romantic tales, Oberon seems more of a literary than a mythological character. He is related to the fairy queens Titania and Mab.
