Legendary Irish king, Ollamh Fódhla (Ollam Fodla, Ollamh Fodhla), is believed to have ascended the throne of Tara in 714 B.C.E. As the first person to codify the law of the Irish land, he holds a significant place in Irish history. The name Ollamh Fódhla appears to mean “poet of Fódla,” and it is possible that he held the position of a Brehon or judge, as poets were also Brehons. Later, he was elevated to the position of the king.
