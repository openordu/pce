Irish lore tells of the deity Ogma (also spelled Oghma or Ogme), who many believe is equivalent to the continental Celtic god Ogmios. The Dagda, a father god known for his benevolence, sired Ogma, who went on to father prominent goddess Étain and the poet Cairbre mac Éadaoine. While not extensively detailed in mythology, Ogma is credited with inventing a writing system known as Ogham, named after him. In addition, he was known for his impressive oratory skills and poetic talents.
