A figure of Irish mythology, Ochall Ochne, was a Fairy king hailing from Connacht's western province. In the Táin Bó Cuailnge, one of Ireland's most celebrated epics, Ochall Ochne held a minor role. The epic's climax saw the two great bulls killing each other. Their dispute was initially started by Rucht, who served as Ochall Ochne's swineherd, and Friuch, another swineherd. Despite being born and reborn repeatedly in various forms, the two continued their never-ending conflict.
