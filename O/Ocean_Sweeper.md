A mystical item from Irish mythology is the Ocean Sweeper (Aigéan scuabadoir). Within the Irish Otherworld, this artifact was considered a wondrous treasure due to its ability to travel through water with the mere thoughts of its pilot. The Ocean Sweeper was initially brought to our world by the brave hero Lugh, but ultimately became the prized possession of the powerful ocean deity Manannán Mac Lir.
