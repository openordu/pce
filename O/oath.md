Ritual acts are an integral part of many societies, including the Celts. In societies like theirs, where there was no written language, great emphasis was placed on verbal truthfulness. Oaths were a means of calling upon divine forces to bear witness to the truth of a statement. Among the Celts, these oaths were often made by invoking either gods or elemental powers like the Sun, Moon, or air, which would then punish the speaker for any falsehood. A common form of the oath among the Celts, who were radically polytheistic, was the phrase, “I swear by the gods my people swear by.”
