Mythological creatures known as dragons were infamous for breathing fire, consuming maidens, and scorching villages throughout medieval legend. These enormous, scaly monsters, occasionally winged and frequently snaky, required heroes to conquer them. In Britain, St. George or St. Michael were called upon to vanquish the evil creature, sometimes believed to be the Devil himself. In Ireland, St. Patrick was favored by storytellers as the dragon-slayer, for he battled and killed the monstrous Corra, Caoranach, and OILLIPHEISt, all described as monstrous beings that were often depicted as serpentine, despite the absence of actual snakes in Ireland. Although some people believe that these images might be a coded message referring to the extirpation of pagan beliefs by the new Christian religion, a theory that has also been applied to the George/Michael motifs, it was not required for saints to fight the dragons in Britain. Regular heroes could step in when required to fight Worms, the term used because worm was the Norse and Saxon word for dragon, although they were not small or insignificant. Famous English dragons included those of Unsworth and Wantley, with the latter having seven heads and three times that many set of eyes. In the 12th century, the Linton Worm was known for assaulting Roxburghshire with its venomous breath before a local hero killed it by pushing a burning brand down its throat. In West Sussex in 1614, there were rumors of a dragon sighting. Some accounts highlighted typical characteristics such as breathing fire, eating sheep and maidens, while others described them as stunning, especially when curled up to sleep, with scales resembling sparkling jewels. Killing dragons was a difficult task due to the protective nature of their shiny scales. A Scottish dragon who had been wreaking havoc around the countryside had made its lair with its brood intact. Multiple attempts to capture the dragon went in vain until Charles the Skipper built a bridge of empty barrels covered with iron spikes. As anticipated, the dragon fell for the trap and impaled herself on the spikes. While the dragon met her fate at the bridge, her dragonets were left defenseless back in the lair and were being smoked to death by the villagers. The dragon, unable to handle the grief of losing her children, fell on Dragon Rock and died there. Although these tales are often attributed to Celtic beliefs, their true origins are unknown. These tales are most prevalent in Wales, a nation whose symbol is that of the red dragon. The Welsh hero who fathered King Arthur was named Uther Pendragon, a name that may mean “dragon’s head.” Certain writers have tried to link dragons with underground rivers while others have associated them with the energy of the earth. The most famous portrayal of dragons in contemporary times is in the works of American-born Irish writer Anne McCaffery. Her famous fantasy civilization of Perth is described in books such as Dragonhold, Dragonflight, The White Dragon, and other works.
