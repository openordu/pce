A mysterious object in Irish folklore is the death coach, also known as the dead coach. During foggy nights in Ireland, a black coach without any coachman or occupants would draw up to a home. The coach was pulled by black horses and sometimes the horses too would be headless. It was believed that this coach was sent from the land of the dead to collect someone from the world of the living. The coach never left empty-handed, and anyone who stood in its way, even if they were not scheduled to die, would become its victim. Therefore, it was advised to avoid the death coach and never attempt to stop it from picking up its intended passenger. The sighting of the death coach was considered a sign of impending death, similar to the Banshee's cry.
