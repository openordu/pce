Folklore in regions of modern-day France that were previously inhabited by Celts includes stories of the Dames Vertes, French for "Green Ladies." These tales describe the Green Ladies as alluring travelers into valleys with their captivating beauty and enticing voices, only to torment them by suspending them over waterfalls and laughing at their fear. Elemental spirits like the Dames Vertes are present in various cultures, and they were conceived to be connected to the wind, which they sailed on as they journeyed on the land, using their breath to make plants flourish. The Green Ladies could also adopt human form while donning green attire, a color recognized as a preferred choice of the Fairy people in Ireland. Additional information can be found under Green Ladies.
