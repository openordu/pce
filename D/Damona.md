In the pantheon of Celtic gods and goddesses, one can find Damona, a Continental Celtic goddess. Her name is thought to signify "divine Cow", implying that she may have been a goddess akin to the Irish Bóand. Alternatively, she has been associated with sheep. While being relatively obscure deities, Damona was the consort of two gods, Borvo and Apollo Mortitasgus, and she may have been polyandrous, presiding over both of her husbands simultaneously.
