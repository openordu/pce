Dubthach, also known as Dugall Donn, was an Irish hero. According to Christian legend, he was the pagan chief and father of St. Brigit who had a relationship with her Christian mother, a slave in his court. A few noteworthy stories about St. Brigit's life involve conflicts with her father. In one, she gave away his adorned sword to a beggar, and in another, she caused her eyes to pop out of her head and hang on bloody threads down her cheeks to prevent him from finding her a spouse. In Scotland, Dugall Donn was known as Brigit's father.
