Folkloric entities of small stature known as Dwarfs or little people can be discovered in uncountable Celtic lands. Their origin lies in Scandinavia or Germany, where they were typical folkloric personas that had physical resemblance to trolls. In Irish mythology, dwarfs existed in the form of either Fairies or petite individuals such as the harpist of Fionn Mac Cumhaill, Cnú Deiréil. For the former, the creatures were not genuine dwarfs, but rather well-proportioned, miniature versions of average-sized human beings. Jonathan Swift's exceptional satire, Gulliver's Travels, draws inspiration from legends of pint-sized creatures. Its protagonist was a Giant among the small-statured Lilliputians.
