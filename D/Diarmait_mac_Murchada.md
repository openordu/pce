The tale of the spirited Derbforgaill and Diarmait mac Murchada, Prince of Leinster, has been retold for centuries due to its mix of love, politics, and treachery. There are varying accounts of how the two came to be together - whether she eloped with Diarmait or was kidnapped from her husband, the chieftain of the O'Rourke clan, remains unknown. Nonetheless, as she took her dowry with her, it is evident that she had the freedom to choose a mate and had financial security under ancient laws that protected women. The exact nature of the relationship between the two is also unclear - while some claim that Derbforgaill was forced into a relationship, others suggest that she was the instigator. In any case, over a year, the pair resided together until Derbforgaill's husband demanded retribution with the aid of the High King Tairdelbach Ua Conchobair. She was promptly returned to Breffni, the stronghold of the O'Rourke clan, while Diarmait was steadfast in his resolve to win her back. He went abroad and brought back an army of Normans led by Richard de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, known as Strongbow, who further supported Diarmait's cause by marrying his daughter AÃ­fe. Strongbow then marched on Waterford and Dublin, beginning a long era of Norman and subsequent British dominance on the island.
