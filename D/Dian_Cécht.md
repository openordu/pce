Irish god Dian Cécht, also spelled Dian Chect or Diancécht, was the Tuatha Dé Danann's master of leechcraft. Whenever the members of this magical race suffered from illnesses or wounds, they turned to him for help. He knew the location of the Well of Slaine, a spring that could heal any wound except beheading. Healing gods were common among the Celts, and Dian Cécht seems to be the Irish equivalent of the healing water gods known in the continent such as Apollo. The invading Roman legions applied the name through the Interpretatio Romana to local healing gods, of which most were connected to healing waters. Despite his powers and knowledge of the secret spring, Dian Cécht did not always succeed in his healing endeavors. For instance, he failed in treating Nuada, the king of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who had battled against the monstrous Fomorians on the plain of Mag Tuired. One arm was cut off completely by an enemy, and even Dian Cécht could not heal a severed limb. A Blemished King could not rule, so Nuada abdicated the throne of Tara to the evil half-Fomorian Bres mac Elatha. The Tuatha Dé Danann begged Dian Cécht for help again when Bres brought chaos to the land. This time, the god crafted a fully functional arm made of silver for Nuada, who became known as Nuada of the Silver Arm. However, this was not enough. Although he could fight with strength using his metallic arm, Nuada was still too damaged physically to rule. Miach, the son of the healer Dian Cécht, famously healed the Irish king Nuada's severed limb with a magical prosthesis. In time, he would completely heal Nuada by helping his skin grow over the silver prosthesis. However, Dian Cécht was fiercely envious of his son's talent and eventually killed him. Airmid, Miach's sister and a gifted healer herself, found her brother's grave teeming with hundreds of herbs - one for every part of the human body and every day of the year. She diligently sorted them to create a comprehensive system for their use. But Dian Cécht, still consumed by jealousy, destroyed Airmid's work and took the healing secrets with him. Subsequently, Dian Cécht was transformed into Mac Cécht, a more mortal figure who became the husband of Fódla, the land goddess and one of the three land goddesses who welcomed the invading Celts.
