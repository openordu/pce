Significant among the historical sites of Scotland is the Dumbarton Scottish mythological site, a massive two-peaked basalt rock located in the northwest of Glasgow that serves as a reminder of ancient glacial activity. The rock of Dumbarton has served as a fortress due to its prominence and defensible position since prehistoric times. The site is renowned for various legends associated with it, such as St. Patrick's resistance against Roman soldiers, who tried to enslave some of his congregation, and reportedly occurred at the site. Despite the veneration of St. Patrick in a famous legend, there are other local folktales that do not speak of him kindly. One such legend describes how witches threw stones at St. Patrick to drive him out of Scotland, and the rock of Dumbarton dropped as a result of their stone-casting. These tales of landscape creation through rock-casting are common among Cailleach, an ancient goddess who, due to the incoming Christians, might have wanted their departure.
