Irish folklore features the Devil's Father (also known as Duveruckan or Duvephucan). This figure appears to have been introduced after the Christianization of Ireland, as opposed to the Devil's Mother who draws on mythical creatures and ancient goddesses from pagan times. The Devil's Father was commonly encountered at wakes, where he sought to join his son in stealing the soul of the recently deceased. His physical features included a phallus-shaped walking stick, a red tail, and three legs, making him easily recognizable.
