In folklore from the far southwest of Ireland, there is a character named Donagha. He was a lazy man who had a quarrelsome wife, Varia, with whom he constantly fought. Fairy folk granted two wishes to Donagha. However, one wish was wasted since he was so lazy that he asked that the load of wood he was carrying should walk home by itself, which it did after gaining legs. Varia criticized Donagha for this and chided him for wasting a wish that could have been used more wisely. As a result, Donagha made another wish asking that his wife be sent far away. In an instant, her cabin flew to Teach na Vauria in County Kerry while he flew to Teach an Donagha which is Donaghadee, located near Belfast in County Down on the other end of the island.
