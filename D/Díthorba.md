Irish hero named Díthorba played a prominent role in the tale of Red-Haired Macha. Díthorba was an Ulster king who supposedly shared the rulership of his kingdom with Macha’s father, Áed Ruad, and Cimbáeth. The story incorporates mystical numbers, as there are three kings with seven-year reigns, and the rulership is further occupied by seven Druids, seven Bards, and seven nobles. The presence of these numbers hints at the tale's mythological nature rather than its historical accuracy. Díthorba opposed Macha, his niece, when she ascended to the throne. Macha fought back and killed Díthorba. His sons fled to the Burren, Co. Clare. However, Macha hunted them down and, disguised as a Hag, tricked them into attempting to rape her. When they attacked her, she overpowered them and tied them up. Macha then led them back to the Ulster capital called Emain Macha, where she forced them to dig the Hillfort that remains visible today.
