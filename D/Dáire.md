A frequently encountered name in Irish mythological history and mythology is Dáire, an Irish hero. The name means "fertile" or "fruitful" and is occasionally Anglicized as Dara, but it may also originate from doire, meaning "oak" or "oak grove." Some scholars suggest that, though the different figures linked to the name seem to have regional associations and appear to be distinct, they may all be traced back to the same source, maybe a god such as the Dagda, who ruled Fertility. In addition to various minor figures in the Fenian Cycle, the most significant figures connected to this name are:
• Dáire, the father of Lugaidh Laíghde and his four brothers (who were also named Lugaidh); Dáire received a prophecy that his son Lugaidh would become king of Ireland, so he gave that name to all of his sons to hedge his bets.
• Dáire, the son of Fionn Mac Cumhaill (sometimes known as Conán), who was swallowed by a monstrous worm that he killed from within to free himself.
• Dáire of the Poems, a bard and musician of the Fianna, a band of heroes, who was renowned for the beauty of his songs.
• Dáire Derg, meaning "red Dáire," a one-eyed rogue whose offspring, the Fothads, were enemies of Fionn Mac Cumhaill.
• Dáire mac Dedad, the forefather of the Érainn people, one of the original races in Ireland, maybe an ancestor god that was euhemerized or reduced to a mortal.
• Dáire mac Fiachan, the keeper of Donn Cuailnge, the great brown Bull pursued by Queen Medb in the epic Táin Bó Cuailnge. Agreeing to trade the Donn for Medb's "friendly things", Dáire's decision was influenced by his apprehension of appearing weak after hearing the boasts of Medb's men who disregarded his consent and insisted on taking the bull by force. Consequently, Dáire resolved to combat them. This consequential decision ignited the Cattle Raid in his regions, situated in the Cooley Peninsula in Co. Louth, becoming a prominent event in the saga.
