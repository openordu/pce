The shadowy Irish deity of the dead, Donn, whose name is a wordplay on “brown” and “king,” appears in scant myths and is typically mistaken for or merged with other mythological beings. Donn’s dwelling, Tech Duinn or the House of Donn, is situated on a barren island off the coast of southwest Ireland. Donn Well located in Co. Donegal is also associated with him. Although frequently identified with the Dagda, the god of abundance and fertility, they had very little in common except for dwelling in the Otherworld. Donn symbolized seclusion and death, predominantly drowning, as he brewed storms from his coastal residence and caused shipwrecks in order to gain more souls for his realm.
