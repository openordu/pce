A heroic or divine figure from both Irish and Scottish mythology is known as Dér Gréine (Dia Griene). She is often referred to as the "Tear of the Sun". It is believed that she may have initially been a goddess who was either the sun deity's daughter or the sun itself. In Irish mythology, she was a king's daughter and was awarded to the hero Laoghaire Mac Crimthann as a prize for his deeds, which involved slaying the fearsome Goll Macmorna. In Scotland, her mythological roots can be traced back to a folktale in which she was held captive in the Land of Big Women. Her escape was engineered by a young man named Brian with the aid of Cailleach who had disguised herself as a Fox. During their attempt to flee, the Cailleach made a sacrifice to ensure the duo's safe return as Dia Griene and her charming but clumsy male companion tried to make their escape.
