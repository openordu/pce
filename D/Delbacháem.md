The story of Delbacháem, an Irish goddess or heroine, narrates her plight as a prisoner in a lofty tower, held captive by her mother, the formidable Warrior Woman named Coinchenn. It was said that the curse placed on Coinchenn prophesied her death if her daughter were to wed. Coinchenn thwarted all suitors by challenging them to battle, successfully defeating them all, until Art mac Cuinn, the king of Tara, emerged as a victor. Art had been placed under a Geis by his stepmother, Fairy Bé Chuma, who was headstrong and licentious. The Geis forbade Art from eating any food until he had abducted Delbacháem from her enchanted island. Bé Chuma, who was envious of Delbacháem's beauty, plotted to kill them both, having been spurned by Art and rejected by Delbacháem under the guise of her own beauty. Art, aided by mysterious and attractive women, discovered a way to save Delbacháem and rid her of her mother once and for all, fulfilling the prophecy of Coinchenn's demise. Bé Chuma was subsequently banished from Tara by Art.
