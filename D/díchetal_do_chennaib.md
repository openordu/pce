Within the context of Irish Divination rituals, there is a particular form that remains quite enigmatic among the many that were employed by the ancient Irish; this is the díchetal do chennaib. The manner in which this ritual was described as “composing on the fingertips” has left scholars unsure as to whether it involves psychometry, a means of divining information through touch, or if it is a type of incantation utilizing fingertips as mnemonic devices for memorization. It is possible that Bards and seers among the Druids used it as a form of prophecy, drawing meaning from a spontaneous, unstructured outburst of speech. In spite of its roots in Celtic religious customs, St. Patrick permitted its ongoing practice while other divinatory processes were prohibited since it did not entail the invocation of the ancient gods.
