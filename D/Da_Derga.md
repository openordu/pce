In ancient Irish tales, there exists a narrative that explores the traditional Celtic concept of Kingship through the character of Da Derga (also known as Da Dearga or Ûa Dergae), who is either a god or a hero. This tale predominantly takes place in the hostel or inn owned by this obscure figure. The story follows the king of Tara, Conaire, as he arrives at Da Derga's hostel on the enchanted Samhain (November 1) feast. Conaire had previously broken a series of sacred vows (known as the Geis), and as a result, he is faced with his eventual doom while within the hostel's walls. Initially, a hag approaches him, demanding entrance, and upon being denied, she curses him while standing on one leg, like a crane. This event is swiftly followed by Conaire developing an unquenchable thirst, which not even water from any source in Ireland could satiate, ultimately leading to his demise. Throughout it all, Da Derga shows no inclination to help him and essentially agrees with his punishment. While the name and overall identity of Da Derga are unclear, some texts describe him as Ûa Dergae, "nephew of the red goddess," while others refer to him as Da Derga, "the red god." If the former is accurate, Da Derga may be related to Medb or Flaith, the goddesses of Sovereignty, as the story's primary focus is the punishment of the king for failing to uphold sacred vows as required by the earth goddess. On the other hand, if the latter is correct, Da Derga may be a god from the Otherworld, given the association of the color red with that particular realm. In the story named after him, Da Derga plays a minor role and has virtually no personality attributed to him.
