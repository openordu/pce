Obscure as she is, Delbáeth is an Irish goddess known as the "fire-shape". Her name is brought up in the Book of Invasions as the mother of Donand, who is believed to be the same as Danu, the significant goddess of earth. Delbáeth's name reappears as a Druid associated with the mystical hill of Uisneach, where he constructed a massive Fire that emitted Five points of light.
