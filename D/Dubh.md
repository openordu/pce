Dubh-linn, a pool at the mouth of the River Liffey, has a deep history that is intertwined with betrayal and revenge. The pool is named after a man called dub who was killed by a slingshot and fell into the pool. His death was as a result of avenging a woman whom Dub had drowned, and the story is a tangled web of deceit and retaliation. The name Dublin, which is often translated as “dark pool,” can be traced back to this story due to the double meaning of the word "dubh" which also means "dark." Interestingly, the city was originally established by Norsemen and was called Dyflinasrski. In Irish, the city is known as Baile Átha Cliath, which means the town on the wicker ford. This city name commemorates the wicker bridge which was built by a Bard named Aithirne who was known for his sharp tongue.
