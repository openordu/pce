Scottish legend tells of a heroic figure called Dòideag who is believed to have been a witch from the Isle of Mull. Many credit her with causing the downfall of the Spanish Armada, while others blame her depending on their political leanings. The power to control the weather is often associated with the Cailleach, a legendary hag who seems to have served as the inspiration for Dòideag.
