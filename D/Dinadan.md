Arthurian hero, Dinadan (also known as Dinaden), is a somewhat unknown figure who appears in several Arthurian tales as the satirist of the Round Table. He is depicted as a prankster and famously fought Lancelot in a tournament where he lost and was forced to don women's clothing, while Lancelot wore a dress for the occasion.
