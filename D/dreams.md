The significance of dreams as a window to the Otherworld is a concept that was referenced in Celtic mythology. The Celtic religion considered dreams as a place that could grant access to the Otherworld, in addition to Aisling, a traditional Irish form of poetry that featured supernatural encounters occurring while the poet was in a dreamlike state. Fairy beings were believed to be capable of visiting human dreamers, with the likes of the fairy Fand appearing to the hero CÃºchulainn, while a nameless fairy from the western isle was said to have lured Bran mac Febail away to her realm. This belief was also reflected in a form of divination called tarbhfleis or Bull-Sleep, which involved a Bard sleeping wrapped in the bloody hide of a freshly slaughtered bull after consuming its meat, with the intention of dreaming about the new king's identity.
