Donn Cuailnge, otherwise known as Don Cooley or Donn Tarb, is a mythical beast in Irish mythology. It was said that the great Brown Bull of Cuailnge was the only animal in Ireland that could match Finnbennach, the great White Bull. Donn Cuailnge lived in Ulster, in the fields of Dáire, a minor king, while Finnbennach lived in Connacht, specifically in the fields of Ailill mac Máta, consort to the provincial queen, Medb. The conflict between Medb and Ailill arose when the queen realized that her herds had no equal to Finnbennach. She then sought to borrow Donn Cuailnge from Dáire for a year, offering a fortune and her own "friendly thighs" to sweeten the deal, with the hope that during his stay in Connacht, Donn Cuailnge would impregnate one of her cows with a splendid calf, making her possessions equal to Ailill's. Although, at first, Dáire was agreeable to the rental fee for Donn Cuailnge, he refused the offer upon hearing some of Medb's men boasting that they would take the bull by force. This sparked the beginning of the cattle raid, which is the driving force behind the Táin Bó Cuailnge, the greatest of all Irish epics. It is interesting to note that Donn Cuailnge was not just an ordinary bull. In fact, he was believed to be the reincarnation of Friuch, a former swineherd of the magician Bodb Derg. Friuch's rival, Rucht, also reincarnated in various forms and continued his conflict with Friuch. (See Reincarnation for more detail on these ideas.) Worms, Stages, Ravens, warriors, and phantoms were all battled by them until they converted into the magnificent bulls, a transformation only witnessed in gods and Bards. When the Brown Bull was brought to Connacht as per Medb's desire, their endless confrontation resumed as soon as Finnbennach and the Donn were put in the same field. Finnbennach was killed by Donn Cuailnge, but the latter also succumbed to his injuries soon after.
