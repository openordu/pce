Irish hero Dathí, also known as Dathi or Daithi, was purportedly buried in Cruachan, which was the great provincial capital of Connacht. According to legend, a Standing Stone, which existed prior to his reign in the fifth century C.E., was placed on his grave. Dathí's reign in Connacht lasted 23 years, and he was the last pagan king of Ireland. He was Niall of the Nine Hostages' nephew and succeeded to the throne at Tara. However, there is some evidence that suggests that the historical Dathí was not a king but rather a successful warrior who invaded the continent and was later promoted by annalists.
