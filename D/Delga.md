Obscure and ancient is Delga, the Irish hero whose palace, Dún Delgan, still persists today in the significant city name Dundalk. His race remains a subject of dispute, as some stories claim him to be a member of the Fir Bolg, a group of legendary Irish invaders, while others consider him a Fomorian. Unfortunately, not much is known about Delga.
