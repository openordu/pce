The fleetfooted woodland herds of deer were symbolic animals to the Celts as the wild version of their own domesticated cattle. The Celts believed the deer herds, like the herds of cattle guided by a strong Bull, had a virile leader, the Stag. These animals were associated with gods of masculine power, Esus and Cernunnos, respectively. Doe and Cow were similarly parallel, and their goddesses Flidais and Boand symbolized maternal love and abundance. In mythology, deer offspring also appeared, notably in the story of Sadb who gave birth to her fur-faced son Oisín the Bard, whose name is still used in Irish to mean “fawn.” In the Scottish Highlands, Giant goddesses tended vast herds of deer, while the island of Jura (from the Norse for “deer island”) was occupied by Seven Big Women who ran with the deer. The Cailleach named Beinne Bhric was a Hag who could shapeshift into a gray deer, in contrast to hesitant Seals or Swans, shy creatures vulnerable to being caught and tamed, the deer women of legend were eager to mate with human men. Such folklore led some to theorize an ancient cult of the deer, as the animal was viewed as sacred, perhaps even totemic or related to humanity as distant ancestors. Fainter traces of such a religious vision are present in Ireland and Wales, which may suggest that the cult died out earlier there or that it was exclusively Scottish.
