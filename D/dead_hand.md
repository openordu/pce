An object of Irish folklore is the "dead hand." The belief was that a hand severed from a deceased person, particularly one who was murdered, executed as a criminal, or a child, possessed significant magical power. It was commonly believed that carrying a dead hand would prevent a thief from being caught, and simply stirring cream nine times would yield massive amounts of butter.
