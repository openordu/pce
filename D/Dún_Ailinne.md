A provincial capital of the Celts in the seventh century C.E., Dún Ailinne is a great Hillfort located in Co. Kildare. Its origins can be traced back to the Neolithic period. It is considered the eastern counterpart to Cruachan in Connacht and Emain Macha in Ulster. Presently, the area goes by the name Knockaulin Hill. Latest excavations at Dún Ailinne have led to the uncovering of numerous banks, which are one of the most massive earthworks in the region. Moreover, a broad causeway and the foundations of ancient edifices have also been discovered at the location. Naming of the site has been done in honor of Alend, a little-known goddess.
