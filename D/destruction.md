Within Irish mythological text, the category of heroic tales includes various types such as visions (see Aisling), voyages, cattle raids, and wooings. One specific type is known as destruction tales, which depicts the destruction of a building, often by flame. The title denotes this theme. The well-known tale, the Destruction of Da Derga’s Hostel, portrays a king’s death due to his failure to comply with the sacred vows that corresponded to his societal position (see Geis).
