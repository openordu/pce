Symbolic structures known as dolmens dot Celtic lands, standing as doorways of stone leading nowhere. These stone structures are found in fields, pastures, on rocky hills and in verdant valleys, and are called dolmens, which means “table of stone” in Breton. While contemporary archaeologists prefer the term portal tomb, in Wales they are called cromlechs, from words meaning “bent” and “flat stone”. Druid altars is another common name for dolmens, although they were built thousands of years before the Celts and their priests arrived in the land. Even after approximately 6,000 years have elapsed since their creation, these structures created by the mysterious prehistoric people can still be seen throughout the land, their engineering proving to be so precise. While dolmens are often referred to as tombs due to indications of burials found in recesses beneath them, these burials were few compared to the population. Some of those buried beneath the dolmens might have been victims of human sacrifice, or may have been individuals of high status who were given an esteemed burial. Nevertheless, these structures may have had purposes other than funereal. In fact, dolmen-like structures found in the Canadian arctic serve as both geographical markers and shamanic pathways to another world. Even though the Celts who created many stories about the dolmens arrived much later, tales such as “beds of Diarmait and Gráinne” are still told in Ireland, wherein the fleeing couple reportedly slept on different dolmens each night while escaping Gráinne’s furious intended husband, Fionn Mac Cumhaill. The dolmens are linked to Fertility and sexuality, as per this myth, as well as in frequent folktales which suggest that the stones either result in sterility and barrenness or increase the probability of conception. These legends may reflect pre-Celtic conceptions of the pre-Celtic structures, might be of Celtic origin, or might signify Christian insertions into Celtic legend.
