Dylan, also known as Dylan Son-of-Wave and Dylan Eil Ton, is a Welsh hero or god. Arianrhod was asked to prove her virginity to become the ceremonial footholder to king Math of Wales. However, when she stepped over Math's wand, a baby was born from her womb, without her being aware of her pregnancy, and fled into the sea. Dylan is often referred to as Dylan Ail Ton or Ail Mor, meaning "son of the wave" or "son of the sea". He is believed to be the child of Arianrhod, with a sea god or Merman. Dylan's element was the sea, and he enjoyed swimming like a fish and feeling the waves under his body. However, he was killed by his uncle, the rapist Gilfaethwy, who had initiated the entire story by assaulting Math's previous footholder. Moving on to Dyfr, she was a British heroine whose name is mentioned alongside the Three Splendid Women at king Arthur's court at Camelot. The other two women were the challenging Enid and the virtuous Tegau Eurfron. Dyfr's legend is sparsely mentioned and her only acknowledged lover was Glewelwyd Gafaefawr, a knight.
