Numerous sculptures in Celtic lands claimed Diana as a Roman goddess. However, Diana was not initially a Celtic goddess, similar to the Greek Artemis. In the ancient time, she was an Italic goddess of the sky, and in Roman times, she turned into a Goddess of the hunt and the moon. The invading legionnaires introduced the Roman name to Celtic lands and renamed goddesses alike. Consequently, several Celtic goddesses lost their identities, and their names are lost to history. It is quite challenging to identify how the original Celtic goddess relates to the Roman import. Still, some goddesses retained their names and identities such as Abnoba, goddess of the Black Forest; Arduinna, boar goddess of the Ardennes forest; the Cailleach, pre-Celtic Scottish goddess, Artio, the bear goddess of Britain and Gaul, and Flidais, the Irish maiden of the woodland.
