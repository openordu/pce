Divination was a crucial aspect of Celtic ritual, with the Druids being responsible for attempts to gain insights into future events among both the insular and continental Celts. Early accounts of Celtic culture, all recorded by their Mediterranean foes, suggest that they were highly superstitious. Tacitus and Strabo, who were both Romans and therefore had a motive to depict their enemies as uncivilized, described the Celts as regularly reading the still-beating organs of sacrificed individuals. This evidence of human sacrifice is not universally accepted. However, other accounts are less contentious, such as the use of animals in divination ceremonies and the interpretation of omens based on the flight of birds. Evidence from Ireland, which was not influenced by Roman culture but may have been affected by the Christian beliefs of those who transcribed it, indicates that the Druids, especially the Bards, engaged in divination frequently. Several intricate and sophisticated techniques were employed to reach the altered states required for prophesying: incantations, such as the DÃ­chetal Do Chennaib; psychometry, which involves reading auras through objects, such as the Teinm Laeda; trance states, as in the Imbas Forosnai; and writing using letters, as in the Ogham script. Druids also employed plants in their divination work, and the rods carried by the Druids were considered viable for divining. Some texts suggest that Druids engaged in yoga, holding themselves in specific postures while speaking their prophecies. The most complex and intricate divination ritual was used to select a new king, which involved a poet consuming raw meat before being wrapped in a fresh bull-hide to dream of the new king (see Bull-Sleep). While professionals were necessary for complicated issues, regular Celtic folk also practiced divination in the hopes of obtaining knowledge about their fates, as people before and after them have done. Omens and dreams could be read by ordinary folks to predict the future on several significant days throughout the year, most notably on November 1st during Samhain.
