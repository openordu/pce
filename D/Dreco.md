Irish mythology tells of Dreco, a notable figure among the Fomorians, a race of beings considered monstrous in the Book of Invasions. As an accomplished sorceress and Bard, Dreco once defeated a group of 20 warriors sent to capture her using a lethal potion. Her impressive achievement took place in the esteemed location of Nephin (Nemthend) with a view of Lough Conn in Co. Mayo. Irish place-name poetry provides insight into this historic event, further portraying the legendary reputation of Dreco.
