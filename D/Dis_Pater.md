A Continental Celtic god named Dis Pater (also known as Dispater and Dis) was designated by Julius Caesar with a Latin name which means “Father of Hell” because he thought he was the primary deity of his enemies in Gaul. However, the Celts did not conceptualize an underworld for post-mortem existence or a location of punishment, implying that Caesar may have been mistaken. Furthermore, Caesar supposed that his Celtic opponents had a pantheon comparable to that of Rome, equipped with a centralized administration and a hierarchy of importance. In reality, however, the Celts did not arrange their gods in a bureaucratic system. It is difficult to discern which god Caesar and his forces renamed Dis Pater, but three deities have been suggested: a hammer-bearing god known as Sucellus or Taranis, the horned god Cernunnos, and the woodland god Esus (known by the Romans under the name of the similar divinity Silvanus). It is possible that this god was one of the divine beings of the Otherworld, the Celtic realm of the gods which eventually became associated with the realm of Fairies and somewhat resembles the Roman underworld. Nonetheless, the Celtic Otherworld was not a disconcerting place, but rather exceedingly beautiful, timeless, and inhabited by talented immortals.
