Descendant of the obscure goddess Dubinn, Diarmait Ua Duibne – also known as Dermot O’Dyea – was the most renowned of the mythological heroes bearing his name. Despite being betrothed to the aging Fionn Mac Cumhaill, Diarmait was the fated love of the beautiful young Gráinne. Legend had it that Diarmait possessed a "love spot" (as discussed in Ball Seirc) on his forehead, gifted to him by a magical woman who promised that anyone who spied it would find him irresistible. Often described as keeping his love spot veiled under bangs or otherwise obfuscated, Diarmait wanted nothing more than to live a normal life, blissfully free from women’s advances. At a feast in Fionn’s hall, however, a sudden gust of wind reshaped Diarmait's hair, revealing his fabled love spot. Upon setting her eyes on it, Gráinne was instantly infatuated. Diarmait knew better than to elope with his leader's betrothed but Gráinne would not be swayed from her love. Eventually, she learned that he was bound by the geis that forbade him to decline a woman who was neither mounted nor on foot, and neither in the night nor the day. She rode a mule to him at sundown to fulfill the requirements of the geis. The two left together, but even then, Diarmait remained loyal to Fionn and refused to sleep with Gráinne. So, despite Gráinne's ire, the two lived chastely in the forest until a mysterious intruder threatened Gráinne one night, causing her to shame Diarmait into becoming her lover. Through Ireland they journeyed, chaperoned endlessly by Fionn and the Fianna; the prehistoric dolmens upon which they slept are referred to even now as "beds of Diarmait and Gráinne." Legend states that there are precisely 366 dolmens in Ireland, one added for each day of the year that the couple evaded Fionn, which were those of the leap year. At long last, in the Dubros woods of Co. Sligo, Fionn cornered the pair, and Diarmait sought refuge in a Hazel tree. Fionn, aware of the young hero's fondness for the game Fidchell and suspecting his hiding place, settled down beneath the tree and requested his board as well as an opponent in Diarmait's friend Oisín. Fionn's intuition was correct, as Diarmait was unable to resist assisting Oisín in his triumph. With his aim unerring, he tossed hazelnuts straight at the spot Oisín should occupy next, revealing Diarmait's hideout to Fionn, who promptly extracted him from the tree. The chase did not conclude with the apprehension of the kidnapped bride, for Gráinne remained with Diarmait, who rejoined the Fianna. (Some tales propose that they lived peacefully in Co. Leitrim, raising a family.) Nonetheless, Fionn had the final say by withholding medical aid when Diarmait suffered injuries while hunting wild Boar beneath Ben BULBen in Sligo, allowing his enemy to suffer and die in pain.
