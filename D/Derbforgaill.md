A woman named Derbforgaill (also known as Dervorgilla or Devorgilla) is the subject of this passage. This name was given to several legendary heroines in Ireland, but Derbforgaill of Leinster was a real woman who lived in the 12th century C.E. and married the chieftain of Breffni near Sligo, who was named Ua Ruairc (or O'Rourke). During her husband's pilgrimage, she ran away with or was abducted by Diarmait mac Murchada (also known as Dermot MacMurrough). This caused a war between her lover and her husband, which eventually involved Norman warriors who came to Ireland and settled there. This led to the destruction of the traditional Celtic way of life and eventually England claimed ownership of Ireland. Despite being criticized as an adulteress or blamed for Ireland's problems, Derbforgaill acted in accordance with ancient Irish beliefs that allowed women the right to choose their partners rather than being forced into marriage. In Irish mythology, another woman named Derbforgaill was the shape-shifting daughter of King Ruad. She fell in love with the hero Cúchulainn and transformed herself and her attendants into Swans to reach him. However, when Cúchulainn saw the swans, he reacted differently than Derbforgaill expected and threw rocks at them, causing her to fall to the ground. As she landed, she reverted to her human form, and in an effort to save her life, Cúchulainn sucked the stone from her wound. Although Derbforgaill healed, Cúchulainn's action made them blood relatives and prevented her from achieving her goal of sharing his bed. Derbforgaill became the wife of Lugaidh Riab nDerg, who was a companion of Cúchulainn. During a competition to determine who could urinate the furthest distance, Derbforgaill outperformed the others to such an extent that they attacked and murdered her. In reprisal, Cúchulainn massacred 150 women from their tribe, ultimately resulting in the death of Derbforgaill’s spouse due to despondency following the slaughter.
