Darlughdacha, also known as Darludacha, was a heroine in Irish mythology. The conversion of the Celtic goddess Brigit into a Christian saint with the same name led monkish writers to create a human biography for her, where she was depicted as an abbess of the religious center in Kildare. St. Brigit's companion was Darlughdacha, which means "daughter of Lugh," the Celtic god. It was said that they even shared a bed together. One story describes how Darlughdacha burnt her feet intentionally after admiring a warrior, and Brigit miraculously restored them to their previous state. Some scholars suggest that it is more likely that Darlughdacha was a lost Celtic goddess who was transformed into a Christian nun, rather than a historical woman who served as the companion of the Christian Abbess in Kildare.
