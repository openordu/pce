A fort located in the Aran Islands, known as Dún Aonghusa (Dún Angus), was constructed by the Fir Bolg, said to be the second mythological population to settle in Ireland. This fort, named after their chief Angus, utilizes a steep cliff as a form of security on one side while the remainder is composed of stone.
