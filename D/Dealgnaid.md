An Irish heroine named Dealgnaid (also known as Delgnat, Elgnat or Elgnad) was the wife of the invader, Partholón, when he arrived in Ireland. In his quest to expand his territories, Partholón left his wife alone with only Togda, a handsome servant, for company. Togda and Dealgnaid became intimately involved, much to Partholón's dismay upon his return. However, he took the responsibility upon himself, realizing that he should not have left his wife alone, knowing her desires. As a result, the couple reconciled, and Dealgnaid subsequently gave birth to the ancestors of the Partholonian people.
