The concept of death held by the Celts was cosmological in nature. Archaeological findings show that they believed in a permeable boundary between the world of the living and the dead. The hearth and burial grounds were considered places where the deceased could return to the world of the living. Julius Caesar observed that the continental Celts believed in reincarnation, while other writers of his time believed that the valor of Celtic warriors stemmed from the belief that they would be reborn to fight again.

There is debate among scholars about whether these accounts reflect actual Celtic belief. Burial practices have been used as evidence in this regard. In the centuries preceding the Common Era, the continental Celts buried their dead with grave goods like mirrors and weapons. These graves have yielded some remarkable archaeological finds. Later, however, the Celts shifted towards cremation, which may represent a change in beliefs or an adoption of Roman customs. Among insular Celts, there is no evidence of burial until the first century B.C.E., indicating that cremation or excarnation (exposure) was the norm.

According to myth, parts of the human body, such as the head, may have been preserved, particularly in the case of those killed in battle. The dead did not exist in a separate realm like the Christian Heaven or Hell, but instead maintained a relationship with the living. This relationship could be either positive or negative, depending on the events of their earthly life. In the Scottish Highlands, death was not seen as a termination, but rather as a transubstantiation, a change in form. According to local belief, the dead could return to harm the living who had wronged them. The Celtic idea of the Otherworld, inhabited by gods and fairies, was later combined with the Christian realm of the dead. This led to some confusion between the dead and the fairies, as the Irish farmer who was abducted from his cabbage garden found out. He was surrounded by the dead, who spoke in an unfamiliar language, and he was only able to banish them by invoking the name of God. In modern times, people still sometimes mistake the dead for the fairies, as both are believed to sneak into our world to cause mischief. The land of the dead was often located in the far western sea, sometimes as an unstable floating island. However, some Irish texts suggest that Spain was the home of the dead, though this may have been meant as satire. Some also think that there may have been a belief in reincarnation in Celtic myths and traditions, which could explain why there was so little concern about where the dead went. Celtic warriors were known for their bravery in battle, as they believed that death was simply a passage to another life. In Irish folklore, it is believed that the dead could come back to the world of the living for certain reasons, or on particular days, even before another body is discovered. These folktales frequently recount instances of young mothers who revisit every night to tend to their abandoned infants, and of lovers who return to keep watch over their beloved. It's also common for the deceased to return simply to sit by the fire and enjoy the soothing activities of their past life. Most frequently, this return took place on the festival of Samhain, which falls on November 1 when the boundary separating the worlds of the living and dead was thin. During Samhain festivities, both those seeking retribution and those seeking favors from family members were thought to return. This suggests that the relationship between the living and the dead was seen as continuing beyond the moment of death.
