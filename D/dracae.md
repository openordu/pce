The dracae act as malevolent water spirits in Scottish folklore. They use their powers to transform themselves into appealing golden objects seemingly floating just beyond the grasp of those passing by in Lakes and Rivers in the attempt to lure them in. Once the victim tries to capture the gold cup, it fades away, causing them to fall into the water and ultimately drown. The dracae have held some people captive before, a captive that served under them as a midwife and was found in an enchanting underwater world. After her release, she realized that she could see through the dracae's disguise, portraying themselves as ordinary people walking among us, as she had smeared her eye with fairy ointment.
