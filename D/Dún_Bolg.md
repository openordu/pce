At the legendary site of Dún Bolg, the warriors of Leinster demonstrated their unwillingness to pay the bórama, or Cow-tribute, demanded by the king of Tara. Their ingenious plan, not unlike the trickery of the Trojan Horse, involved hidden warriors bursting out of baskets attached to the backs of the tribute-carrying cows, and successfully battled the king's soldiers. Cúchulainn, on the other hand, found his home in Dún Delgan, which was named after the Fomorian chieftain Delga. The Irish town of Dundalk bears the same name. Also known as the stronghold of warrior woman Scáthach, Dún Scaith was situated at the Isle of Skye near Isleornsay. Its name also referred to a portal to the Otherworld on the Isle of Man that Cúchulainn's army used to capture the Cauldron of abundance.
