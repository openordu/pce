A ubiquitous hero in Irish and Scottish folklore, known as Domnall (Donal, Domnal, Dónal, Donald, and sometimes, Daniel), has been associated with several minor heroes and kings. Among the significant figures are Domnall of Tara, who succeeded the insane king Suibhne, and Domnal Míldemail, the Scottish king who received Cúchulainn, the hero, in his lands. The father of Cúchulainn's intended bride, Emer, sent him to Míldemail's kingdom, fearing for his daughter's safety.
