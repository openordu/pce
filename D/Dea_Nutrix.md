Dozens of small pipe-clay statuettes portraying three similar female figures holding an array of fertility symbols have been excavated in several Roman British temples. These figures, known as Dea Nutrix (or Deae Nutrices in plural), are believed to be Celtic goddesses – counterparts of the triple Divine Mothers, Deae Matres. Furthermore, when depicted alone, the goddesses often hold an infant while highlighting their association with nourishment. The original Celtic name for these deities has been lost, leading to their identification through a Latin term for “nourishing goddess”. It appears that the worship of Dea Nutrix spread widely throughout Europe as her representation has been found in Southern Germany, France, and England, either in temples or as offerings in sacred springs and graves.
