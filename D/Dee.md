Dee, also known as Deva, was a British goddess. Her name, meaning "the goddess," was attributed to the British River, which was believed to possess a feminine divine force like most rivers in Celtic territories. According to a folk rhyme, the River Dee required a regular supply of human sacrifices, amounting to three each year. However, the River Don needed none. The Romans referred to Dee as Deva, which was a variant of their own term for "goddess."
