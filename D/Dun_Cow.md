The Dun Cow, or Y Fuwch Frech and Y Fuwch Laethwen Lefrith, is a legendary figure in British and Welsh folklore. She roamed the land, similar to the Irish Glas Ghaibhleann, and provided milk to anyone who requested it. Despite her generosity, malice befell her as some individuals killed her to make stew or milked her into a sieve, leading to the cow's demise. In Lancashire, the Dun Cow perished at "The Old Rib," where her large rib bone was displayed for a long time. As for Y Fuwch Frech and Y Fuwch Laethwen Lefrith, she gave birth to two oxen called the Ychen Bannog, who defeated the monstrous Afanc. Another Dun Cow was an enchanted and ever-fertile creature belonging to an Irish Saint who tanned its hide into vellum for use as a book after its death. The Book of the Dun Cow serves as an account of several of Ireland's greatest myths, notably the Táin Bó Cuailnge, the legendary narrative surrounding a cattle raid.
