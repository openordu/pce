Irish legend tells of a renowned fairy ruler named Donn Fírinne, who reigned over the magical Tuatha Dé Danann. His palace, or Sídhe, was nestled within the mountain of Knockfierna (also known as Cnoc Fírinne) located in Co. Limerick. In local folklore, Donn Fírinne was famous for abducting mortal women to join him in his fairy revelries. Given that these women were never again seen above ground, some speculate that Donn Fírinne may have been linked to the enigmatic king of the dead in Irish myth known as Donn.
