The cosmological concept of duality can be interpreted in two distinct manners. In some cases, writers may use it analogously to dualism - the philosophical separation of the universe into two opposing categories, such as black and white, light and dark, or male and female. A popular philosophical dualist was Augustine of Hippo, a Christian bishop who initially followed the teachings of the Persian sage Mani before embracing an either/or worldview following his conversion. Augustine launched a fervent and ultimately successful campaign against the competing philosophy of Pelagius, a supposedly Celtic monk and the founder of the "happy heresy" that viewed the natural world as meant to fulfill the wishes of God. However, Augustine rejected the physical and specifically sexual world as detrimental to gaining admission to heaven, a viewpoint that persisted long after Pelagianism faded away. Subsequent Church Fathers, heavily influenced by neo-Platonist notions that the "ideal" world is superior to the "real," backed a dualistic understanding of sin and salvation. In contrast, the double vision of the Celts was not dualistic in this sense. Celtic art from the earliest times demonstrated an affinity for forms that were both one thing and another (like the Ram-Headed Snake) or intended to be viewed from two distinct perspectives. Divinities had a propensity for doubling or even multiplying and could transform themselves at their pleasure. Therefore, Celtic dualism suggests a worldview that regarded the universe as replete with complementary pairs, rather than opposing one another, such as light and darkness or male and female, which could be perceived as part of a more significant whole.
