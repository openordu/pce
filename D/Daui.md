Irish mythology speaks of a hero named Daui, who was embodied by two individuals. The first, Daui Dalta Dedad was a king of Tara, who resorted to blinding his brother such that he would not be able to rule. This action proved to be fruitful as Daui gained power, but his reign was short-lived as he was assassinated only seven years later. The second figure, Daui Ladrach, a king who was equally ambitious and had a tendency to kill to ascend the throne. However, his ambition proved to be his downfall as warrior Lugaidh Laíghde was able to outsmart him and clear the path for his own ascension.
