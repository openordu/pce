The concept of the Devil in Christian cosmology was absent among the Celts. Rather than having a dualistic worldview that was pitted with light against darkness, they leaned toward something more ambiguous, where darkness and light were balanced against one another. With the advent of Christianization in the area, some Celtic gods were reinterpreted in this new religion as being negative forces. This is a normal pattern; gods from one religion can become demons in the next. It was the god Cernunnos, the god of wilderness from continental Celtic mythology, that was the primary model for Christian iconography of the devil. This was because of his horns and partially animalistic body. As goddesses were gradually demonized, they were sometimes referred to as the Devilâ€™s Mother.
