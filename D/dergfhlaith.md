Dergfhlaith is an Irish ceremonial drink which derives its name by combining the words for dark red, sovereignty and ale. It is referred to as “the dark-red ale of sovereignty” and is given to the king by the earth goddess to confirm their union. Although the Irish Inauguration custom is believed to have continental Celtic origins, there is a disagreement among scholars regarding its evolution from the integration of Celtic intruders with an earlier, goddess-oriented culture. The red ale's acceptance unites the king with the land, establishing a bond of sacred vows and regional responsibilities (see Geis and Buada) in addition to the generosity and nobility expected of all Irish sovereigns. Myths link the red ale explicitly to Medb, the goddess of sovereignty who became the queen of Connacht; it is also connected to other goddesses of the land including Ériu and Flaith.
