Euphemisms such as Daoine sídhe were used to refer to the Fairy people of Ireland. This label translates to “folk from the mound,” which gives reference to the Fairy’s belief to reside in the ancient Barrows, Hillforts, and other prehistoric monuments of Ireland, as seen in Fairy Mound. The Irish also made use of other cordial and flattering terms to ensure that the amoral and occasionally mischievous fairies would grant them good will, such as The Good Folk (daoine maithe), The Gentry (daoine uaisle), and Them.
