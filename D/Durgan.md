An Irish heroine named Durgan suffered an unfortunate fate due to her truthful ways. To elaborate more on this, Durgan's mother, named Herccad, engaged in a relationship with one of her slaves. Durgan, being honest and loyal, reported this to her father. As a consequence, Herccad arranged the murder of her own daughter in an attempt to maintain her reputation.
