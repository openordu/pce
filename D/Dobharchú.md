The Dobharchú, also known as Dorraghow or OtterKing, is a legendary figure in Irish folklore. He is depicted as a black-and-white striped king of the Otters who never sleeps and possesses supernatural abilities to hunt and kill humans. According to the legend, the only way to slay the Dobharchú is by using a silver bullet. However, it is dangerous to hunt this creature, for it is said that a successful hunter is likely to die within a day of the hunt. Despite the risk, obtaining even a small piece of the Dobharchú's hide is worth the danger, as it protects the holder from drowning. In historical times, unscrupulous merchants would sell bits of non-kingly otter fur to sailors who needed protection from death by water. Additionally, several families claimed to be descended from otters, including the McMurrows.
