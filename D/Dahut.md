A princess named Dahut (also called Dahud, Ahés, Ahé, and Keben) was a celebrated Breton heroine and goddess. One of the most well-known folktale from the region centers around her and her magnificent city, Ys, which shone behind its seawalls off the Brittany coast at La Raz's end. Others speculate that it could have been located in today's harbor city of Douarnenez. She followed the old religion and the land's ancient powers, while her father, King Gradlon, was Christian. The sea magicians known as Korrigans assisted her in constructing the world's most impressive city. They erected massive walls that contained marshy land and were cleverly painted in gold by Dwarfs. The gates that prevented the floodwaters from entering could only be unlocked by Dahut, who wore the key around her neck. A stunning palace was built, with stables that featured marble floors matching the horses' colors. Riches from the sea were the source of her wealth, as she had captured and tamed sea Dragons that brought her wealth from distant lands daily. Magnificent homes were erected within the prospering city of Ys, which became famous as Paris itself would pale in comparison, being only a reflection like Ys (par-Ys, a false etymology), but nowhere near as grand. However, the people of Ys became hardened and selfish, not tolerating beggars or even commoners within their splendid city. They welcomed only the wealthy and beautiful. Despite her subjects' miserly demeanor, Dahut's city was a place of incessant music and song, as she welcomed processions of princes and nobles from all over the globe in her grand palace. In the palace lay a sinister secret. Every night, Dahut secretly bestowed a mask to the most comely of her guests, promising that it would grant him access to her bedroom in the tower, without being detected. The guest would then eagerly go by the guards and sneak into the princess's embrace. As the night of pleasure came to a close, the chosen individual would wear the mask again to return to his entry point. However, the mask would compress tighter and tighter, depriving the hapless man of his breath, and once he succumbed, his dead body would be thrown into an abyss between Huelgoat and Pualoauen. Inevitably, Dahut met her match one night. She was dancing with a prince who caught her attention with his charming gaze. Intriguingly, he asked for a specific tune on the pipe, and as they danced, everything became a blur. Everyone around them, too, danced faster and faster, their dread rising as they realized they could not stop. It was then that the stranger — perhaps a devil or a sea demon named Cado, who desired Dahut in his realm forever — slipped his hand into Dahut’s hidden neck-pouch and retrieved the silver key to the great seawalls. While the people danced, he opened the sluices, and the water began to engulf the city. They watched it pour into the ballroom and around their feet. Their fate was sealed. The only one among them who was able to escape was the Christian king Gradlon, who was led away by Saint Coretin. The saint provided a horse for the king, who rode to Dahut's palace to rescue his daughter. However, as soon as Dahut mounted the horse behind her father, it refused to move. Saint Coretin urged Gradlon to push his daughter into the water, and the king did so. In a desperate move, he pushed Dahut into the turbulent sea. The horse then moved again and struck the Rock of Garrec on the Breton coast, where its hoofprint is still seen today. According to some versions, Dahut was thrown into the abyss where her victims rested, the Abyss of Ahez. Others believe that she remains alive and serves as a mermaid, floating above her submerged city and continuing to lure men to their doom. It's possible that the story of Dahut has its roots in ancient Celtic mythology, and with the advent of Christianity, the condemnation of pagan rituals became so intertwined with the tale that it's difficult to distinguish between original elements and those added to make it an instructional parable. At the beginning of the story, Dahut lives in harmony with nature and the elemental spirits, which enable her to enjoy a regal life in her glittering city. The fact that she brings both life and death to the city implies that she may have been inspired by a misinterpretation of a deity associated with the cycle of life.
