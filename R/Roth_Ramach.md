A powerful means of transportation appears in Irish mythology as the Roth Ramach. This vehicle, referred to as a "flying wheel," was utilized by Tlachtga, a witch or goddess alongside her father, the magician Mog Ruith. Capable of flying great distances, they traveled effortlessly to Italy on this flying wheel. The remnants of this legendary machine are said to be present in a stone near Dromline located in Co. Tipperary.
