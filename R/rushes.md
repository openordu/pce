Symbolic plant, rushes, played a significant role in Scottish fairy lore as they were believed to indicate Fairy hiding places. The concept of FairyLAND's entry points being situated in places that were neither one thing nor another is consistent with rushes growing in a spot that was wet but still formed solid ground, thus creating a liminal area.
