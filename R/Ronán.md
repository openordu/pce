In Irish mythology, there is a tale about the hero Ronán. This story strongly echoes the Greek myth of Phaedra, who became enamored with her stepson, was rejected by him, and spitefully accused him of raping her. Similarly, Ronán's second wife, who was considerably younger than her husband, fell in love with her stepson who was closer to her in age. When the young man rejected her advances, she falsely accused him of rape, which led to Ronán executing his own son. When the truth was finally revealed, Ronán died of heartbreak, and his wife took her own life. Another figure by the name of Ronán (also known as Rodán and Ruadán) was responsible for the destruction of Tara, the once-great central hill that served as the political and spiritual capital of ancient Ireland. When Tara's king, Diarmait, sentenced him for hiding a relative accused of murder, Ronán placed a curse on the king and Tara itself, leading to a significant decline in power for the once-thriving location.
