A Celtic deity known as Rigisamus (Rigonemetis) was worshipped on both British and French soils, and his name was derived from “most kingly” or “most regal.” The god was not well-known, however, dedications have been discovered. Another god, Rigonemetis, “king of the sacred grove,” was also likened to the Roman god of war, Mars. Rigru Roisclethan (Rígru Rosclethan), an Irish female figure from the Otherworld, cried out terribly and led a lowing cow before King Conn of the Hundred Battles while appearing to him once near Tara. The woman warned the king, who had made an attempt on her son’s life, that as long as the licentious queen Bé Chuma remained in power, the land would suffer.
