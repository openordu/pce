Irish legend tells of a hero named Rath who fell victim to the alluring songs of a group of Mermaids, ultimately being torn apart by the creatures. Although Mermaids were not typically known to be violent, their hypnotic melodies were considered dangerous as they could entice humans and take them to the Otherworld to become their romantic partners (refer to the concept of Fairy Kidnapping).
