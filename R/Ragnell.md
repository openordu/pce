In Arthurian legend, Ragnell stands out as a remarkable heroine. She was cursed with an enchantment that transformed her into a Loathly Lady, also known as Cailleach. Despite her unappealing appearance, Ragnell maintained her friendly and helpful character, and with her wise guidance, Gawain, a member of the famed Round Table, solved the riddle of what women truly desire. As the story progressed, Gawain fell in love with the Cailleach's sagacity and kindness. Later, when they exchanged marriage vows, Ragnell disclosed that she had the power to change into a beautiful woman during the day or metamorphose into a Hag at night. She sought Gawain's preference for which form she should take. Gawain, understanding of her internal conflict, granted her the liberty to choose for herself. Ultimately, this broke the enchantment, transforming her into a stunning young woman thereby revealing that women want to have control over their lives. Scholars speculate that Ragnell was a representation of the goddess Sovereignty. Geoffrey Chaucer, the 14th century medieval English poet, based his "Wife of Bath's Tale" in the Canterbury Tales on Ragnell's story.
