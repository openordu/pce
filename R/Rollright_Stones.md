The Rollright Stones are a location steeped in British myth. This Stone Circle, located on the border of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, is associated with many legends. One such legend describes the Rollright Stones as Countless Stones that cannot be accurately counted. According to the tale, a clever baker attempted to count the stones by placing a loaf of bread on each one, with the intention of gathering and counting the loaves later. However, the baker never had enough loaves to cover every stone, as the loaves seemed to disappear once placed on the rocks. Some scholars believe that these legends originated from an ancient practice of offering food to the stones. 

Another significant legend surrounding the Rollright Stones involves an invading king who heard a prophecy that he would become the ruler of the entire island if he saw the town of Long Compton. The king set out to find Long Compton, but some of his own knights opposed his goal. While camping near the Rollright Stones, these knights plotted against the king. Fearing treachery, the king set off in the night but met a Witch before he could reach the hill from which he would see Long Compton. The Witch turned the king and his whispering knights into stones, with the King Stone being the most prominent among them. The legend claims that if the spell is ever broken, the king and his army will conquer England. At present, they remain petrified, while the Witch who turned them into stones survives as an Elder tree in the vicinity. Some people even claim to have witnessed the stones sneaking down to a nearby stream under the cover of darkness to quench their thirst. At each midnight, the stones awaken and begin to dance as the King Stone drinks. While the stone circles pre-date the arrival of the Celtic people, there is proof that a Celtic Hillfort once stood nearby.
