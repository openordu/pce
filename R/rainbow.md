The symbol of the rainbow has been regarded cosmologically among various cultures, including the Celtic lands. It is the radiant bridge of colors that decorates the sky following a spell of rain. The rainbow has amassed several legends surrounding it. In Germany, the Celtic regions believed that the rainbow left traces of Gold on every spot it touched on the earth. To validate this belief, a slightly hollow coin was minted, which was named regenbogenschüsselchen (meaning, a rainbow coin), known for its therapeutic properties. In Ireland, the Leprechaun, a fairy shoemaker, was thought to conceal his gold at the close of a rainbow.
