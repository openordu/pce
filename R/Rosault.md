In Co. Mayo, there once lived a colossal creature known as Rosault, a mythical monster hailing from Irish lore. Despite its aquatic origins, Rosault found itself stranded on land where it began to display a grotesque symptom - nauseous vomiting. Unknowingly, the monster's every heave resulted in the death of all living beings within its vicinity, be it plant or animal, and even human. Sadly, the relentless cycle of regurgitation eventually caused the demise of the creature itself.
