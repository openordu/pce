The rat is a creature of British folklore. Though it is uncertain whether the Celts initially believed that rats and mice had magical abilities, a remnant of this belief may still be observed in the Cotswolds region of Britain, where they were considered to possess prophetic or precognitive powers. Leaving a house suddenly by rats or mice was perceived to be an omen of death in the family. While being in a boat, seeing rats swimming by, or seeing a rat or mouse in a sieve in Scotland, was a sign of the probable death of someone at sea.
