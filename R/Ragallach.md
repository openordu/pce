An Irish hero, Ragallach (Raghallach), ruled the western Province of Ireland, Connacht, in the seventh century C.E. Despite some historical evidence about his life, his elaborate tales are mostly legend. Ragallach, driven by his greed for power, planned to kill his nephew, the only possible rival for his throne. Since the nephew came to him with guards but chose to leave them behind out of shame, the king could easily put an end to him. Due to this cruel act, the Druids predicted that Ragallach would later be killed by his own children. To avoid this fate, Ragallach made a dramatic announcement that shocked everyone: he ordered all his children to be killed. While most of his progeny met their untimely end, his queen, Murieann, saved their unnamed daughter and hid her in the woods. Thankfully, a poor woman found her and raised the little girl as her own. The daughter grew into a beautiful young woman, and her reputation eventually reached the king, who, in keeping with his character, demanded to see her. Unbeknownst to him, the girl was his daughter. Murieann, insulted by the king’s crude infatuation, escaped from the court. Some saintly men were outraged by the king’s conduct and decided to fast in protest against it. On the next Beltane night, the feast of summer’s beginning, the king found himself magically ensnared when he chased a magnificent stag racing through the land. Incidentally, he wounded the animal and went after it, only to find the beast's body being divided among hungry peasants. The man had claimed ownership of the meat, yet the dispute led to his death at the hands of the other men. The story does not mention the daughter again, whose beauty was apparently the reason behind the king's downfall. It is noted that jealousy caused the death of Queen Murieann, but it is unclear how the prophecy was ultimately realized, and whether the starving peasants were the children of the king in a literal or figurative sense.
