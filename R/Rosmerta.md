"The Great Provider" was the name given to Rosmerta, a Continental Celtic goddess who was believed to be a deity of abundance by the people of northeastern Gaul. Supporting this theory was her depiction holding a Cornucopia, or horn of plenty, as well as her connection to the deity of commerce known as Mercury by the Romans. It is worth noting that Rosmerta did not need a consort and sometimes even accompanied the image of the emperor. This suggests that she was a very important goddess with a prestige that may have been greater than that of Mercury, who was believed to be the chief god of the Celts by the Romans. There were also instances where Rosmerta was referred to as a goddess of Spring, which held significance to the Celts as a symbol of healing. This association could also explain Rosmerta's reputation as a force of abundance since she was connected to the symbolism of the fertile River goddess at the sources of rivers where springs were found. Furthermore, Rosmerta's name has been linked to a Celtic word for protection and fertility, and she was sometimes portrayed holding the Cauldron of rebirth. While Rosmerta's importance and symbols are well established, there is still not much known about her myth or ritual.
