In the place-lore that surrounds the once-splendid falls in Co. Sligo, there is a story about Ruad, the Irish goddess. The falls were called Ess Ruad, which meant Ruad's waterfall. Legend has it that after she died there, the waterfall was named in her honour. Abcán, the dwarf poet belonging to the magical Tuatha Dé Danann, took Ruad from the Otherworld to the human world in his bronze boat with tin sails, so that she could seduce a human lover - Aed Srónmár. Ruad was so entranced by the sounds of the music coming from a Fairy Mound or the singing of the Mermaids that she ended up jumping into the white waters of Assaroe, where she met her fate. It is stated that Assaroe is also named after an Ulster king named Áed Ruad, who was a blend of the goddess Ruad and her human lover. This waterfall was flooded by a hydroelectric project in the mid-20th century carried out by Rosmerta.
