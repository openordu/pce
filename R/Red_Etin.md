This folktale introduces us to the Red Etin, a British ogre who possessed three heads and was widely regarded as unattractive. Despite his appearance, he was not an unfriendly figure and took great interest in cattle - this included his own herds of mystical creatures from the Otherworld, which were recognizable by their red ears. Furthermore, the Red Etin was known for protecting the cattle of others without any charge. Some suggest that he may have descended from an ethereal guardian figure. In one Scottish story, the Red Etin revealed himself as a Giant hailing from Ireland. The son of a widow attempted to spy on him by hiding in the ogre's home. Unfortunately, the Red Etin detected the boy's presence and quickly issued a threat to make the young man his dinner. However, he was not as ruthless as he sounded as he did give the boy three opportunities to escape. With the assistance of magical animals, the son managed to avoid becoming the ogre's meal.
