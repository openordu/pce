An important family of the province of Connacht gave birth to Ríonach (or Riona), an Irish heroine and the mother of Christian St. Colman. Her child's potential to become a royal due to her heritage (see Matriliny) sparked the interest of aspiring rulers who sought the throne. Afraid of the worst, these rivals pursued Ríonach during her pregnancy. Having no way out and faced with the possibility of losing her kin, the desperate woman jumped into the waters of the Kiltartan River near Gort, Co. Galway. She did not drown, however, but found herself carried downriver. Eventually, she washed ashore near Corker where a magical Ash tree broke her fall, and she brought forth her son. In that spot, two monks, one of them blind, and the other lame, found Ríonach cradling her infant. She pleaded with them to baptize her baby, but there was no water within her reach. One monk got hold of some wet rushes, and a holy Well burst forth at that very same spot. The monk who had gone blind washed his eyes in it and recovered his sight, while the other, who had been lame, also recovered his ability to walk after cleaning his leg. Colman grew into a man and later became the patron Saint of the region. Although a Christian story, it contains many Celtic motifs.
