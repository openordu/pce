Hero of Irish mythology, Rifath Scot is believed to be one of the workers on the biblical Tower of Babel according to the Book of Invasions. As punishment for human arrogance, God cursed the workers and caused them to speak different languages, with Rifath Scot speaking Scots Gaelic. Goidel, one of his descendants, eventually developed the final version of the language.
