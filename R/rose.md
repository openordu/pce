Symbolic in nature, the rose is a fragrant flower that holds a special place in the histories of divination and magic. Although it is often associated with romance in contemporary times, in Celtic regions it holds a deeper significance, representing love and loyalty. Among the communities in the British Cotswolds, the rose was used for crafting spells of enchantment, either to draw love towards oneself or to capture the wandering heart of a potential lover.
