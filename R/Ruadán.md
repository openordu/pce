An Irish deity or champion named Ruadán, who was previously described as the son of goddess Brigit and the half-Fomorian ruler Bres mac Elatha, appears in the Book Of Invasions, which recounts the mythical history of Ireland. In the momentous second battle of Mag Tuired, Ruadán was found spying on the adversary and suffered a fatal injury. His mother then arrived at the battlefield and let out a certain type of mourning known as Keening (from Irish word caoin, which means "lamenting") that became customary at funerals in Ireland.
