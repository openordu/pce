An Irish hero, Ruadh, was captured by a Fairy Lover, which is a familiar trope in Irish mythology. While out sailing, his boat became motionless off the coast of Ireland. Ruadh decided to swim for help but was drawn under the surface and into the arms of nine beautiful princesses. One of them bore his child while he lived with them. Ruadh ultimately departed from the women, pledging to return, but remained in Norway for seven years without ever intending to go back. When he finally made a reappearance, the nine fairy maidens intercepted his ship, throwing his son at him and causing both of their deaths.
