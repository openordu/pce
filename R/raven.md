The raven is an animal with symbolic meaning. It is not always easy to tell the difference between the raven and the crow without proper training. They both belong to the Corvus genus and share similar dietary habits, such as devouring dead animals. This feature led to the belief that the birds were associated with war goddesses like the Irish Mórrígan and Badb, who were known to take the form of the birds to encourage slaughter. Ravens and crows were also viewed as oracular, and were thought to represent the goddess who cleaned the clothing or armor of those destined to die in the following day's battle. As a symbol of both death and rebirth, the raven's meaning is complex and can appear contradictory. Despite the ancient tradition attributing bad luck to ravens, they continue to carry a significant meaning. If one is noticed during the construction of a new house, it signifies an unlucky outcome for the project, and if they stick around a home, it is interpreted as an indication of someone's impending death.
