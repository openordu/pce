Thome Reid is a Scottish figure from folklore who allegedly visited Elizabeth (Bessie) Dunlop, a Scottish woman from Ayrshire in 1576. Clad in gray except for his black bonnet, he appeared one morning to offer her riches on the condition that she renounced Christianity. Despite her repeated refusals, Thome persisted in visiting Bessie and revealing that he was a soldier named Thome Reid who had lost his life on the battlefield. Sometimes Thome was accompanied by “good wights,” small beings who resided with him in Fairyland. Though Bessie never agreed to accompany Thome there, he provided her with counsel on curing her neighbors, and she became a well-known herbalist who only accepted food as payment. Despite Thome's encouragements to abandon the earthly realm for his he came from, Bessie remained steadfast in her loyalty to her religion and the world. Nonetheless, her faithfulness failed to spare her from being charged with Witchcraft and ultimately burnt alive.
