Irish mythology features the god Ruad Rofessa, which translates to “the red one who has great knowledge”. This name was associated with multiple deities, including the Dagda, who was the god of fertility, and Donn, a mysterious figure of death from the Otherworld. The legends surrounding this god are muddled and perplexing, leaving the question unanswered as to whether he was initially a distinct ancestral god or if the title was simply an honorific used for other divine beings.
