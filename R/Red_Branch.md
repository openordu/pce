Warriors of the Red Branch, a group of Irish protectors of the northern Province of Ulster and parallel to the heroic band - Fianna - who safeguarded Leinster to the east. The legendary Cúchulainn stands as the most esteemed warrior of the Red Branch, heroic for his valiant efforts in fighting off Queen Medb of Connacht's army all on his own. Some scholars recognize in stories of the Red Branch warriors an anticipation of King Arthur's Round Table knights. For further information on the Red Branch, see Ulster Cycle.
