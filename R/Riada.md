Irish hero Riada, hailing from the lineage of Munster kings, guided his people away from famine towards better living conditions. After a lengthy journey, they arrived in Co. Antrim of Ulster before crossing the Irish Sea into Scotland. The regions were subsequently named Dál Riada after him, honoring his legacy.
