A little-known deity amongst the Continental Celts is Rudiobus, who is only recognized from a solitary artifact - a statue of a horse, perhaps symbolizing either the god in horse form or a tribute to him. Rudiobus has been associated with the Romano-Celtic god, Mars, who is referred to as Mullo and is thought to possibly be related to mules.
