The Round Table is a legendary object in the Arthurian tales. It was constructed for Arthur’s father, Uther Pendragon, possibly in another world, and later used by King Arthur and his knights at Camelot. The table came to represent equality between the knights and their king, as well as the brotherly bond between them. However, when Mordred, Arthur’s illegitimate son born of his half-sister Morgause, seized control of Camelot, he destroyed the center of the Round Table, shattering the symbol of harmony and peace promised by the legendary kingdom.
