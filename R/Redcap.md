A menacing figure in British folklore is Redcap. He was known to wear a little hat, which he regularly washed in the blood of his victims, whom he scared to death from his lurking spots in old ruins. His eyes were red, possibly from tirelessly watching out for new prey in complete darkness. If one were to come across an aging man with unkempt hair, iron boots, and a large iron weapon while exploring ancient castles, the only way to ward off Redcap was to hold up a Bible, which caused him to give off a terrifying screech before vanishing. Though on rare occasions, Redcap acted as a helpful Brownie, willing to assist around the house; however, generally, he was a menacing spirit to evade.
