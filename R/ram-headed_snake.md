In Gaulish religious art, there is a representation of an unusual creature that combines the features of a mammal, reptile, and sometimes a fish. This creature is referred to as a ram-headed snake and is considered a symbol of Continental Celtic religion. The exact meaning of this creature is uncertain since it is only depicted in connection with deities and as an ornament on religious artifacts. However, it is often shown with Cernunnos, who is the god of wild lands, and may have been associated with fertility.
