A Continental Celtic goddess known as Andarta was worshipped by the Voconces, a tribe residing in the same region as the goddess. Some experts have associated Andarta with the warrior goddess Andraste due to the similarity in their names. Additionally, others have interpreted that Andarta could have been worshipped as a goddess of wildlife, as the second syllable of her name, “art,” is also present in the name of many Celtic Bear divinities.
