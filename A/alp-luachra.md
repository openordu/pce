An Irish legend, the alp-luachra was a mischievous water sprite that could cause stomach troubles when swallowed accidentally. To rid oneself of the sprite, one had to eat salty food without drinking any liquids and then sleep next to a stream. The alp-luachra, desperate for water, would then jump out of the person's mouth and into the nearby water. Some speculated that an alp-luachra was actually a transformation of a small amphibian called a newt, which would grow within the body and cause illness until it was expelled.
