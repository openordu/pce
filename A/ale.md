A significant sacred object in ancient Irish culture was a type of alcoholic drink called dergfhlaith or "red ale," made from hops and malt. Mead fermented from honey was also popular among the Irish. This drink had ritual importance as it symbolized the goddess of Sovereignty, who offered a cup of dergfhlaith to the new king during his inauguration. The drink was originally brought to Ireland by the Partholonians, though refined by the mythological race, the Tuatha DÃ© Danann, to the point where the ale of their Smith and brewer Goibniu could confer immortality to the drinker. The association between ale and the blurred boundaries of the Otherworld are attested to by Irish epics like The Drunkenness of the Ulstermen as well as the Adventure of Nera. Ancient brewing cauldrons have been discovered through archaeology, but no evidence of storage vessels; thus drinking may have been confined to a seasonal event in ancient Ireland.
