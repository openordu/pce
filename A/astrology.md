The Celts, being a tribal people with an outdoor way of life, had extensive knowledge of the stars. They might have converted this knowledge into an obscure science where the movements of the planets had an impact on life on earth. According to Julius Caesar, the Druids possessed superb knowledge in the field of astrology. There is proof that the starting date for St. Columba's Christian education in Ireland was determined by the stars. According to legend, the druid Cathbad cast Deirdre of the Sorrows' horoscope to understand her fate. Although the druids were masters in various types of divination, scant evidence remains of Celtic astrology, which would not be surprising. The only trace of a supposed system is the Irish word 'nélador,' which means to divine from the sky or 'clouddiviner.' Such potent and delicate information was passed down orally, and hence it is improbable that any Celtic astrological text will ever be discovered.
