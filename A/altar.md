Stone altars inscribed with dedications to Celtic gods have been unearthed in Britain and on the Continent, but these do not reflect Celtic custom, since they were actually Roman in origin. Although a few sources, such as the Roman Cicero and the Irish Cormac, make mention of Celtic altars utilized for sacrificial purposes, the description of these altars indicates they were in fact dissimilar to the stone replicas of meal tables that were brought to Celtic territories by Roman legions. Instead, it is believed that, in accordance with customary Celtic practice of outdoor worship rather than worshiping indoors, the original altars of the Celts were likely shapeless boulders or heaps of sizable rocks. For further information, consult Sacrifice.
