Antlers bear a symbolic image in Celtic mythology. Animal forms were often assumed by the Celtic divinities, which pointed towards their connection with shamanic transformation as explained in Celtic Shamanism. Occasionally, the deities would be observed in human form, yet with animal attributes. Among these, the most frequently featured were the Horns or antlers, with the latter indicating prosperity, and they were adorned by both gods and goddesses. For further information on this, refer to Cernunnos.
