A British and Welsh sacred site called Anglesey or Mona was believed to have served as a Druidic college. As recounted by the Roman historian Tacitus, the island off the coast of Wales was once home to a Druid sanctuary that was destroyed in a brutal attack by Roman forces around 59-64 C.E. During the battle, Celtic priestesses or women, dressed in black, shrieked like the Raven-goddess Mórrígan while their fellow priests fought fiercely against the intruders. Given that the Romans had already massacred the clergy and destroyed the sacred groves of other Celtic peoples, the druids of Anglesey knew that their fate would be no different, and their revered trees would inevitably suffer the same demise. Consequently, the druids were either killed in battle or executed, and the vast forests were razed to the ground. However, relics of Anglesey's affluence and splendor still remain. The bogs and lakes of Anglesey have yielded abundant treasures in Celtic design, indicating that the Druids might have concealed them during or prior to the invasion. Before the arrival of Celts, Anglesey was possibly revered by pre-Celtic people, as an old Cairn situated on the hill of Bryn-Celli-Dhu suggests. The Celts usually appropriated the holy sites of their forebears; therefore, Anglesey wouldn't have been an exception to this rule. The destruction of Anglesey has been portrayed in numerous contemporary fantasy works, with Diana Paxon's Arthurian trilogy being the most prominent example.
