One type of Irish literature, known as Adventure (echtra), often contains mythological elements. These stories typically involve a journey to the Otherworld, although a subset of these tales called Voyages (imram) also describe Otherworldly encounters. Several famous examples of this genre include: the Adventure of Art Son of Conn, which details the fairy woman Bé Chuma's attraction to Art, the son of the king of Tara; the Adventure of the Sons of Eochaid (Mugmedón), which chronicles the birth of Niall, another king of Tara; the Adventure of Nera, which tells the story of a warrior who enters the Otherworld through the cave of Cruachan; the Adventure of Connla, in which a Fairy woman entices Connla to the Otherworld; the Adventure of Cormac, in which the king is lured by the Fairy Music to seek an Otherworldly lover; and the Adventure of Laoghaire (Mac Crimthann), in which the titular king aids an Otherworldly peer in gaining the freedom of the peer's captive wife in the surface world.
