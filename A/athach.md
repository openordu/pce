Monstrous beings known as athachs terrorized the Scottish Highlands, slaying travellers and flinging them into gorges or down rocky slopes. Among those feared creatures were the female luideag of Skye and the male díreach of Glen Etive - the latter possessing one hand jutting from his chest and a single eye on his forehead. For further related information, consult Fachan.
