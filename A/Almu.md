This text concerns an Irish goddess named Almu who was honored in the eastern Province of Ireland, Leinster, specifically on the Hill of Allen which was once the sacred capital of the province. This hill was surrounded by the Bog Of Allen and was personified as Almu, which means “all-white” and also applied to the royal citadel on the hill’s crest. The hill was reputed to have an invisible entrance to the Otherworld and the Otherworldly king Nuada was its original possessor until Fionn Mac Cumhaill won it from him by strength of arms. Fionn was born on the hill, and his “chair”—a small mound—was located on its summit. It should be noted that Almu was often mistaken for Dún Ailinne or Knockaulin, near Kilcullen, the former residence of the kings of Leinster.
