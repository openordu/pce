Symbolic material, ashes were significant in many Irish folk traditions, consisting of remnant ash from peat fires. Some of these traditions stem from the Christian tradition of Ash Wednesday, which marks the start of the penitential season of Lent. It was customary to throw ashes at unmarried people; hence the expression “You’ll have the ash-bag thrown at you,” indicating a person's unmarriageable status. Older, pre-Christian traditions recognize ashes as a Midsummer fertility symbol, which may have formed the basis of the Lenten rite. Ashes taken from the Lughnasa bonfires were utilized to consecrate cattle, fields, and people.
