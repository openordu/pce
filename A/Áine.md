Áine, a prominent Irish figure in mythology, is believed to have been a goddess, heroine or spirit, with the name translating to “brightness” or “splendor”. Though the name is typically associated with the Limerick/north Kerry area of Munster, historically, it has been tied to male figures whereas mythological figures tend to be female. The most notable mythological Áine is Áine of Knockainy, also known as Cnoc Áine. Scholars believe that she was a Sun goddess and connected to Anu or Danu, the great goddess of Munster who gave her name to the Tuatha Dé Danann. She was typically associated with solar wells and had a link to Grian, her sister, who was also a sun goddess. At times, however, she was also described as being related to Finnen, an obscure goddess of the Lough Gur region who represented white. Interestingly, Áine could also take the form of a powerful and unbeatable horse named Lair Derg, and her special feast was held either on Midsummer night, which was the summer solstice on June 21, or during Lughnasa, the Celtic feast on August 1. During this time, people would wave straw torches over animals before driving them up the slopes of Knockainy to seek Áine’s protection. Áine, also known as Áine Chlair, is referred to as such due to her connection with the "cliars" or torches used in ceremonies or from Cliu/Cliach, the ancient name for the territory. She is often called "the besthearted woman that ever lived" by the locals who have reported seeing her on the slopes of her mountain, offering help to those in need in recent times. Áine had a long list of lovers that included both gods and mortals. One of her lovers was the sea god Manannán Mac Lir, while her brother Aillén fell in love with Manannán's wife. To settle this, Manannán gave his wife to Aillén and got Áine's charms. Though known for her lustful ways, she also has a maternal aspect, as her "birth chair" can be seen on Knockadoon Mountain. Maurice, the human Earl of Desmond, captured Áine by stealing her cloak, after which they had a son named Geróid Iarla or Gerald the waterbird. When warned about their son's magical behavior, Maurice remained composed until Geróid was fully grown and was able to shrink almost into invisibility at will. Geróid was said to still be alive, riding around Lough Gur every seven years on a white horse. The descendants of Áine's son, the Geraldines or Fitzgeralds, claimed sovereignty in western Munster by tracing their descent from the goddess of the land. Responsibility for the death of hero Étar, who died of a broken heart after her rejection, and resistance against Ailill Olom, who took her by force and lost an ear in her unsuccessful fight against him, are among the stories told about Áine's romantic relationships. Eógan, the child of Áine's rape by Ailill, is believed by some scholars to have been invented by the Eóganacht rulers to reinforce their hold over the lands under Áine's dominion. Áine also figures in tales of madness, for those who sat on her stone chair became insane, and if they did so three times, they would never regain their sanity. The same process, however, was said to restore the wits of those who were already insane. In another account, Áine appears as a human woman from the parish of Teelin in the townland of Cruachlann, close to another mountain named Cnoc Áine, who fled from her abusive father into the mountain and transformed into a Sun goddess who wove sunbeams. A local folk verse has her recommending ways for unhappy wives to weaken their husbands. Áine also appears in the Fenian Cycle as the daughter of the fairy king Cuilenn or a Scottish monarch, and the lover of Fionn Mac Cumhail, with whom she had two sons; she and her sister Milucra competed for Fionn's love, with Milucra turning him into an impotent old man, but Áine restored him to youth with a magic potion. No mention is made of Fionn choosing either sister as his bride.
