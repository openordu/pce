Ailna is an Irish heroine known for her quest for vengeance after the Fianna, a group of bold warriors, killed her husband Mergah. She transformed herself into a deer, leading Fionn Mac Cumhaill, the Fianna leader, and his musician friend D치ire on a tiring and desperate chase. Soon, Ailna surrounded them with Druid's Fog, preventing them from finding their way home. When D치ire's music alerted the Fianna to their whereabouts and they attempted a rescue, they too became lost in the thick fog. Fionn and D치ire eventually stumbled upon another lost traveler, Glanlua, who asked them for aid. Suddenly, Fairy Music emanated from within the fog, causing them to fall asleep. Upon awakening, Fionn found himself on the shores of a lake, facing a Giant and a beautiful woman, who, as it turned out, were Ailna and her brother, Dryantore. They demanded compensation for Mergah's murder and for the deaths of Dryantore's sons, Mergah's nephews. The pair subsequently imprisoned Fionn and D치ire in a dungeon, but Glanlua became Ailna's companion and revealed to her the existence of a magical drinking horn that could restore health and strength. When the Fianna finally located Fionn, Conan, a wily member, slipped the vessel to him, allowing him to break free from his bonds and escape.
