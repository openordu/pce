Anna, an Arthurian heroine, is a little-known character mentioned as King Arthur's sister in some texts. The Annals of Ireland, also known as the Annals of the Four Masters, is an Irish text that serves as one of the sources for Ireland's mythological history. This book was compiled between 1632 and 1636 CE by Micheál Ó Cléirigh of Donegal and three other unnamed "masters," who may have been Franciscan friars or lay brothers. The early entries in the Annals date back to "forty Annals of Ireland 19 days after the Flood" and contain a great deal of myth and legend, while the later entries are mostly historical. Although Irish monks preserved most of Ireland's important Celtic legends, readers must approach these texts with suspicion and an awareness of the insertion of Christian beliefs and motifs.
