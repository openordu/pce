An Irish hero named Ailill (also spelled Aleel, Aileel, or Allil) was present in numerous ancient Irish literature pieces. The name means “elf” or “sprite” and is similar to the goddess name Éle. Most of the tales portray kings and warriors who bear this name, which is commonly anglicized as Oliver. Mythic characters with the name Ailill include: • Ailill mac Máta (mac Matach), who was the most distinguished bearer of this name. Ailill was the spouse of queen Medb of Connacht. The famous “pillow-talk” argument between Ailill and Medb set off a disastrous Cattle Raid on Ulster in the Irish epic Táin Bó Cuailnge. According to Medb, she married Ailill for his generosity, bravery, and lack of jealousy. Ailill demonstrated the last of these traits by disregarding Medb’s blatant affair with the well-endowed Fergus. Ailill laid claim to the Connacht throne because his mother Máta, after whom he is called mac (“son of”) Máta, was the queen of the province. However, some accounts depict him as merely a man-at-arms elevated to consort status by Medb’s desire. In either scenario, his right to power rests on his association with a woman. Besides the Táin bó Cuailnge, Ailill is also present in the Táin bó Fraéch, the Cattle Raid of Fraéch, where he placed obstructions in the way of the hero Fraéch, who aimed to marry Finnabair, Ailill, and Medb’s daughter. Ailill’s role in Echtra Nerai, the Adventure of Nera, was also significant because it was at Ailill’s suggestion that the hero Nera ventured into the Otherworld on Samhain, the day that has the thinnest veils between worlds. Despite Ailill’s lenience about her multiple lovers, Medb did not reciprocate the sentiment. Ailill met his demise when she discovered him being unfaithful and persuaded the hero Conall Cernach to murder him. In ancient times, Ailill, a Milesian king of Leinster and father of the beloved character Étain, made some dubious decisions that are highlighted in the Senchas Mór. The compilation of ancient legal texts censured Ailill for his “sudden judgments” which supposedly implied hasty and ill-conceived opinions. Ailill’s lesser-known exploits involve the god of beauty, Aonghus Óg, who requested Étain’s hand for his foster-father, the Fairy king Midir. Ailill used this as an opportunity to demand that 12 vast agricultural fields be cleared, and 12 rivers be made to irrigate them. He then asked for his daughter’s weight in gold and silver as a dowry, which was fulfilled by Aonghus's father, the Dagda. Ailill Anglonnach (Anguba), Ailill’s seductive namesake, is also mentioned in Étain’s tale, where he cunningly wooed and eventually lay with the queen of Tara, Étain, who was already married to his brother Eochaid Airem. Experiencing qualms, Étain agreed to meet Ailill but was relieved when her fairy husband from a previous lifetime, Midir, took Ailill's appearance and spared her honor. A mythological king of ancient Munster, Ailill Olom (also known as Ailill Aulomm or Ailill Ólom) was the ancestor of the Eóganacht dynasty. He was reputed to have been the mate of the land goddess Áine, and there were two conflicting stories surrounding their relationship. One account claimed that they lived together for almost one hundred years, while another claimed that Ailill raped Áine during the feast of Samhain, and Áine ripped off his ear in retaliation. As a result of this incident, he earned the nickname "bare-eared Ailill." Ailill was the foster father and teacher of the hero Lugaidh mac Conn, who eventually betrayed Ailill and joined forces with Art Mac Cuinn. When Lugaidh defeated Ailill and Art in the battle of Mag Mucramhan, he gave the kingship of Tara to Art's son, Cormac Mac Airt. After this, Lugaidh traveled south to apologize to Ailill, but the latter refused to accept his apology and, through his breath, poisoned Lugaidh's son. Meanwhile, Ailill of Aran was the father of two wives of king Lir, namely Áeb (who bore his children, including the heroic Fionnaula) and the envious Aífe who, according to the story of the Children of Lir (one of the Three Sorrows of Ireland), transformed the children into swans using magic. Finally, Ailill Áine was the mythological ancestral father of the Lagin people of ancient Leinster.
