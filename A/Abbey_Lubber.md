A mysterious figure in British folklore is the Abbey Lubber, said to haunt the wine cellars of British abbeys where indolent monks indulged excessively in drink. The most well-known manifestation of the Abbey Lubber is that of a spectral horse dressed in the garb of a monk. This entity, known as Friar Rush, was said to reside in a monastery, where the wealthy and dissolute prior attempted to reprimand him for his excessive consumption of alcohol. However, when challenged, the Abbey Lubber revealed its true form and vanished. Such tales may have their roots not in traditional mythology, but in the satirical expressions of the Middle Ages, when corruption in religious orders was a matter of grave public concern.
