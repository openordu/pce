Art mac Cuinn, who was given the name Art, meaning Bear, was an Irish hero and champion widely known. His father, Conn of the Hundred Battles, ruled over Tara with Bé Chuma. However, Bé Chuma both lusted after and sent Art into exile. Art returned to Tara only to be sent on a quest to earn the love of Delbcháem, a woman from the Otherworld. He succeeded and brought her back to Tara, forcing Bé Chuma to depart. Additionally, Art is mentioned in other texts as the companion of Medb Lethderg, a form of the goddess of Sovereignty. Art was mythically notable as the father of Cormac Mac Airt, a great hero whose mother was the magical heroine Achtan. Cormac was conceived immediately before Art's death during the Battle of Mag Mucrama.
