Object of ritual significance, amulets are worn or carried for good fortune or protection against negative forces or entities. Though some distinguish amulets from talismans which are believed to bring good luck, the two terms are often interchangeable in practice. There are instances of Celtic amulets dedicated to specific gods, while intended to attract rather than repel their forces. Worn in various forms, Celtic amulets included those made of precious metals like gold, embossed with divine symbols such as a wheel for solar deities. Additionally, coral was worn by the Celts both as a decorative jewel and as an amulet of protection, as attested by Pliny. Balls of amber or quartz were engraved, and animal figures such as boars, horses, and bulls were shaped from stone or bone and worn around the neck. In Scotland, nuts were hung around the necks of children as amulets to protect them from the malevolent eye. Further information on the most renowned Celtic amulet can be found under the topic of the Serpent Stone.
