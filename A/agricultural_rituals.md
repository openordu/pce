The Celts, initially known as nomadic tribes, eventually developed agriculture which led to the creation of new religious ceremonies to support this new way of life. Whether these ceremonies were Celtic innovations or borrowed from pre-Celtic cultures remains a subject of dispute. Rituals associated with farming, like the presentation of fruits to the god Crom Dubh during Samhain, and those related to herding, such as driving animals between Beltane fires, were observed in Ireland. This indicates a hybrid economy that depended on both fields and livestock. Tales and rituals of Ireland that uphold the belief that the king was married to the region's goddess, with the Fertility of the area hinging on his actions (See Sovereignty, Inauguration), more directly acknowledge the importance of the agriculture industry. In Wales, the human farmer god Amaethon, who could make barren lands fertile, is mentioned in the epic poem Kulhwch And Olwen as a symbol of agricultural fertility, without any recorded rituals.
