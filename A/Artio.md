The deity Artio (Dea Artio, Andarta) was a Celtic goddess worshipped in both Great Britain and continental Europe. She was associated with wilderness and wildlife and took the form of a bear, as indicated by the meaning of her name. The name Andarta was also used to refer to a similar goddess in Switzerland (particularly in Berne, which was known as the "bear city") and France, and the bear connection is implied by the second syllable of her name. Artio shares similarities with the Greek goddess Artemis, who was also depicted as a bear. Some regions also worshipped a bear god named Artaios or Artaius.
