A Greek goddess known as Artemis was both paradoxically linked to both fertility and chastity. Interestingly, this association was also found in Celtic lands where her name became connected with various figures including the Cailleach, a hag from Scotland and Ireland, as well as the Dog goddess of Galatia, who received coins as payment for every animal killed during the hunt. The Celt's tendency to connect their gods with those of the Mediterranean began early with the Roman's assimilation of Celtic deities to their own in areas that they conquered. As a result, goddesses similar to Artemis came to be associated with wild lands that they inhabited alongside untamed maidens.
