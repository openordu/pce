Amadán, also known as Amadáin or Amadáin Mhóir, is an Irish hero or spirit. Each Fairy Mound in Ireland had its queen and likewise a fool, the Amadán, who served the queen wholeheartedly, often causing difficulties without even realizing it. The Amadán had the ability to cause a stroke with a mere touch of his hand on human flesh, as mentioned in Fairy Stroke. The Amadán is sometimes portrayed as malicious in his behavior that led to difficulties for his victims. Nevertheless, he is more often depicted as a foolish character who fails to understand the serious consequences of his acts. The fool also appears in oral folklore and written texts as a helpless and simple-minded human, as exemplified in the story of "Shawn an Omadawn." Several early collectors record the story, which tells the tale of a somewhat naive boy who outwitted his more intelligent companions or siblings. One of the Fenian Cycle stories, called the Adventure of the Great Amadán (Eachtra an Amadáin Mhóir), portrays the fool as the son of a king whose lands were taken away by invaders. In hiding, he grew into a hairy giant who married into the family that dispossessed him, despite his unattractive appearance. However, he eventually sought justice by killing his in-laws. Following numerous adventures and battles, he was reunited with his own family and fought against other giants.
