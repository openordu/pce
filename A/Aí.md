Aoi (also known as Aoi mac Ollamain), an Irish deity, belonged to the magical tribe of Ireland called the Tuatha Dé Danann. A prophet foretold his immense power at birth. This prophecy led a king to plot the murder of the infant. Aí's father managed to save him, allowing his destiny to unfold, although the exact details of this predestined greatness are not known.
