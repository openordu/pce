Arthurian legend features Annowre, a witch or sorceress who, bearing a resemblance to Morgan, developed an unhealthy obsession with the great King Arthur. Despite luring him to her forest, her advances were spurned. Consequently, she imprisoned Arthur and dispatched knights with orders to confront him individually, hoping to dispatch him. However, despite the rivalry, Arthur emerged triumphant. Undeterred, Annowre resorted to sending the knights after Arthur in pairs, and he fell prey to them. With the intervention of the knight Tristan, Nimue helped to release the captive king, whereupon Arthur killed Annowre.
