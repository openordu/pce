Aithirne, also known as Aitherne or Athairne, is a notable Irish hero who appears in several medieval texts. As “the Importunate,” Aithirne represents a less honorable version of the magical Bard of ancient times. He took advantage of the custom in Ireland, which deemed it wrong to refuse a request from a poet, and lived a life of greed. He was so avaricious that his fetal movements caused ale barrels to burst before he was even born. Using his poetic gift, Aithirne would satirize anyone, even a river or any entity that did not provide him with sustenance. A bridge made of saplings was constructed over the River Liffey (now known as Baile Átha Cliath or the town on the wicker ford) because the people in the area were scared of his merciless reputation and built it for him when he wanted to transport stolen sheep across the river. Aithirne repaid them by stealing their wives. His greed knew no bounds, and he even journeyed to the Fairy Mound of Brí Léith to steal the Herons of inhospitality, which he intended to use in his house, despite the requirement that householders be generous and hospitable. He also demanded to sleep with a queen immediately after she gave birth, showing his lack of restraint in the sexual realm. Aithirne's demands became too extreme when he insisted on access to Luaine's bed, who was Ulster’s king Concobar Mac Nessa's bride. Upon her refusal, he composed a satire that caused her to break out in blisters so severe that they killed her. Nora Chadwick's style is straight to the point, hence I will write:

The Ulster warriors took revenge by burning down Aithirne's house, which consequently led to the tragedy of the greedy poet being consumed by the very same flames he desired.
