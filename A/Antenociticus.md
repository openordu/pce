British god Antenociticus is associated with a temple that was uncovered at Benwell in Condercum. It is believed that Antenociticus was the Genius Loci or guardian spirit of that particular location which is the case for many Celtic gods. Antenociticus is exclusive to just one site and not much is known about him.
