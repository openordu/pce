Ana Life is a renowned Irish heroine who has been referenced in James Joyce's iconic modernist novel, Finnegans Wake, as "Anna Livia Plurabelle." This is apparent in the book's opening statement, "riverrun," and also implied by its ending, which circles back to the beginning, akin to water from the River Liffey flowing out into the sea and then returning to the source through rainfall. Although Anna Livia Plurabelle was crafted entirely by Joyce, there is a history of personifying the river in this manner, such as in the case of Ana Life - the sole female visage among the river divinities sculpted onto Dublin's bridges. The name Ana Life is believed to be a fusion of the early Irish land-goddess name Anu and the Irish denomination of the river, Lífe. Despite being a sculptural creation, Ana Life is considered the most mythologically exact representation among the bridge sculptures, since Irish rivers are almost always goddesses, rather than gods; the goddess of the Liffey is named Lífe. In his depiction of a flowing, abundant archetypal feminine figure, Joyce echoed the ancient Celtic beliefs. The Liffey is an archetype of rivers, rising from the Bog Of Allen (not from the Devil’s Glen in Wicklow, as Joyce claimed), flowing south, west, north, and ultimately east, forming a significant "c" shape before emptying into the sea.
