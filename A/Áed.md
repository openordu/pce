A common name in ancient Ireland, Áed (Aedh, Aodh) produced several heroic figures and divinities, and its Anglicization as Hugh gave birth to surname variations like Hay, Hayes, Hughes, McHugh, and MacKay. Some renowned legends have connections to this name, like Áed Abrat, a Fairy King, father to the fairy queens Fand and Lí Ban. Áed Alain, Bébinn's husband, who was the goddess of birth and sister to Bóand. Áed Eangach, the former king of Ireland, was believed to be born miraculously from the side of a pillar on Tara. Despite the expectation of his birth, this "red-handed" king never came to be, and his impending arrival became part of Irish poetic folklore for centuries. Áed, husband of Aíbell, queen of Connacht, fell prey to the powerful and lusty king Mongán who transformed into Áed's form to sleep with Aíbell, using a transfigured crone to hide his deception. In contrast, Áed, the sixth-century king of Tara, owned a magical Cow that he believed would keep him safe in war. However, Áed was killed in battle as he left the Cow at home. Áed Minbhrec, the son of the Dagda, drew the wrath of hero Coincheann after seducing his wife. Coincheann killed Áed Minbhrec, and the Dagda punished him, forcing him to carry Áed's corpse. Coincheann eventually died of exhaustion from bearing the boulder and body near the Grianán Aileach. However, some variations of the story suggest that Áed is still alive and reigning from his Fairy Mound at Mullaghnasee, close to Ballyshannon in Co. Donegal has a rich history of mythological figures, including Áed Ruad, the father of the goddess and queen Macha Mong Rua. He ruled jointly with two other Ulster kings, Cimbáeth and Díthorba, in periods of seven years each. When Áed Ruad drowned in the famous waterfall Assaroe in Co. Donegal, Macha went to war for the right to succeed him. While some consider Áed an Otherworldly figure, others identify him with Goll Mac Morna. Another mythological figure, Áed Slaine, is also associated with Donegal. He has connections to the town of Slane. Meanwhile, Áed, son of Eochaid Lethderg of Leinster, differs from most Fairy Kidnapping victims in that he sought to escape the beautiful but sterile land he was held captive in for three years by two fairy women. Similarly, Áed, son of Miodhchaoin, killed and was killed by the Sons Of Tuireann, making him one of the most tragic figures in Irish mythology. Lastly, Áed Srónmár plays little part in myth except to inspire his beloved Fairy Ruad's fatal trip from the Otherworld to join him on earth; Ruad died before reaching him. It is important to note that while the tale of the Children of Lir details Áed's transformation into a swan for 900 years by his jealous stepmother, the story is also shrouded in mythology.
