A legendary figure in Irish mythology, Amairgin (also known as Amargen, Amhairghin, Amairgein, or Amorgin) was a hero and a renowned poet. The name Amairgin translates to “wondrously born” or “song-conception” and is shared by two poets of folklore. Amairgin, the son of Míl, is considered the first great poet of Ireland and was believed to have existed in the sixth century C.E. According to legend, as the Milesians attempted to invade Ireland, the Tuatha Dé Danann summoned a storm to prevent them from landing. With his enchanting words, Amairgin managed to soothe the tempest, becoming the first of his race to step onto Irish soil. He then recited the “Song of Amairgin,” his most famous poem, where he depicts himself transforming into various objects such as a salmon, a spear, a flower, and a sunbeam. Other Celtic poets, such as Tuan Mac Cairill and Taliesin, also wrote similar pieces emphasizing the connection between magical transformation and poetry. While leading the Milesians through Ireland, they encountered three goddesses of the land, each of whom demanded their new home be named after her. Eventually, Amairgin decided that the island would be named Ériu. As chief poet of the Milesians, Amairgin held immense power as both a judge and seer, and his choice became final. Another historical figure with the name Amairgin hails from Ulster and was married to Findchóem, the sister of king Concobar Mac Nessa. This Amairgin saved Tara by eliminating the destructive monster Aillén Trechenn, who raided the city periodically. He also served as the foster father of Cúchulainn, who later became foster brothers with Amairgin’s son, Conall Cernach. Aithirne, a bitter poet, once paid a visit to Amairgin. However, Amairgin's words were too elusive, leaving Aithirne with no solid ground to launch an attack on him. Besides being a poet, Amairgin was also a warrior. His might was demonstrated in the epic Táin Bó Cuailnge, where his power was so great that corpses amassed around him.
