A Welsh god named Amaethon (also spelled as Amatheon) was known for his association with earthly fertility. His name which means "ploughman" connotes his connection with agriculture. Another notable trait of Amaethon is his connection with wild animals like deer, signifying his connection with fruitfulness and abundance in general. According to the Welsh Triads, Amaethon once took a dog, a deer, and a lapwing from the king of an Otherworld called Annwn. This revelation suggests that the source of the world's abundance is rooted in the mysterious realm that exists beyond the natural world. Amaethon is among the children of the powerful mother goddess, DÔN.
