Connacht prince Aigle, an Irish hero, was killed by his uncle Cromderg as vengeance for Aigle's murder of Cliara, a woman under Cromderg’s protection. The mountain range in Connacht was named after Aigle for a period of time and was formerly named Cruachan Garbrois; the name was changed to Cruachan Aigle. For over 1,600 years, the mountain has been known as Croagh Patrick and is renowned as the location of the decisive battle between Patrick, the Christian missionary, and Ireland's pagan forces.
