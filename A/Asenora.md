A renowned heroine of Cornwall is Asenora, also known as Senara or Senora. According to legend, Asenora, a princess from Brittany, was thrown into the sea in a barrel while she was carrying a child. Although this motif originates from Celtic heritage, it could have come from non-Celtic sources as it is also present in the Greek narrative of Danae, who was the mother of Perseus. Asenora's barrel ended up drifting to Ireland, where she was later rescued. She attempted to return to Brittany but could only reach Zenor, where she established a church in her honor, and now is recognized as St. Senara. Within that church, there is a prominent 600-year-old statue of a Mermaid, believed to be an original representation of a sea goddess from the Cornish region. An interesting aspect of the Cornish tale is that Asenora is the primary focus, unlike the Greek version, and the legend mentions nothing about Asenora's unborn child.
