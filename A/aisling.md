A literary form originating in Ireland is the aisling (or ashling, or aislinge) which refers to a type of Irish poetry that connotes a vision or dream. The most well-known poem of this kind is the Aislinge Óenguso, or The Vision of Aonghus, a story about the god's love for a maiden called Cáer. Another celebrated poem in the same genre is the Aislinge Meic Con Glinne or The Vision of Mac Conglinne, a satire about a sagacious scholar who journeys across a corrupt Ireland filled with corrupt poets and clergy. From the 17th to the 19th century, many aislings were nationalistic poems that told tales of the poet coming across the betrayed and lonely goddess of Sovereignty, wandering on the streets of Ireland in search of a hero. See also: Dreams, Spéir-Bhean.
