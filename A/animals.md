In Continental and insular Celtic mythology, animals and birds are often depicted as accompanying the divinities. For instance, the Dog is portrayed with Nehalennia and Cúchulainn, the Duck with Sequana, the Stag with Cernunnos, the Pig with Moccus, and the Horse with Epona. These animals are believed to be the god or goddess, who has shape-shifted into their form rather than their servants. In some stories, such as those featuring the Cailleach, who transforms into a Hare or Oisín, whose mother shifts into a deer while giving birth, animal shape-shifting is a vital part of the character's mythos. However, in Gaul, where only figure names and no myths are available due to Romanization, narrative descriptions of the bond between the animal and the divinity are not present. Not only gods but also poets and witches, were also believed to have the ability to change into animals. Several poets like Amairgin and Tuan Mac Cairill describe living many lives in different forms, including that of animals, either due to shape-shifting or transmigration of souls. The association of magical transformation with poetry is a typical feature of insular Celtic society, which might also have extended to the Continent. The belief in witches' ability to take on animal form is not exclusively Celtic, and it might have originated from pre- or post-Celtic beliefs. Legends suggest that witch impersonating as hares were able to perform wicked acts. In case a suspected witch had a lousy injury in her thigh, and a night-roving hare was shot in its back leg the next morning, it was concluded that the hare was a transformed witch. Classical writers reported that animals were sacrificed during early Celtic rituals. Julius Caesar famously described these sacrifices, claiming that the Celts of Gaul burned animals alive in cages with human captives annually. However, there is doubt about the accuracy of Caesar's description, as he may have exaggerated the perceived savagery of the Celts to support his conquering efforts. Nonetheless, there is evidence of bull sacrifices for religious purposes, and these animals were likely eaten in feasts. Some animals were generally forbidden for consumption, such as hares, hens, and geese according to Caesar's account of the Britons. Nevertheless, these taboo creatures were sometimes sacrificed on special occasions, such as Boudicca's offering of a hare to divine the future of her people. These taboos often had connections to the belief in descent from divine beasts, like the Irish king Conaire, who was forbidden to hunt or eat birds because his mother was one. The idea that certain families were descended from seals was another example of this ancient tradition, with the belief that they would be punished if they attempted to hunt their former kin. The names of many ancient Celtic tribes also had animal references, such as the Bribroci of Britain, who may have envisioned themselves as originating from an ancestral beaver goddess. Animals have held significant importance in the naming of some clans across Scotland, like the Cinel Gabran which translates to “clan of the little Goat” or the Cinel Loarn referred to as the “clan of the Fox.” Certain Irish names also involve references to animals, such as the McMurrows linked to Otters and the McMahons associated with Bears, among others. These clan names are believed to signify an ancestral bond with divine wild animals rather than domestic ones. For more similar examples, one may refer to Badger, Boar, Cat, Cattle, Cock, Cow, Crane, Crow, Deer, Dove, Eagle, Egret, Eel, Fish, Frog, Heron, Ox, Rat, Raven, Salmon, Serpent, Swallow, Swan, Wolf, and Wren.
