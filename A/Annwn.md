Annwn, also referred to as Annwyn or Annwfn, is a location of great significance in Welsh mythology. Much like the Irish, the Welsh believed that this place was considered to be an Otherworld which could be perceived in different ways. Annwn, which means "abyss", was sometimes viewed as a seagirt castle called Caer Siddi or as a court of intoxication, known as Caer Feddwid. Other times, it was seen as a palace of glass called Caer Wydyr. Similar to the Irish island of the blessed, Tir Na NÃ³g, Annwn was a place of great beauty and delight where its inhabitants were immortal and unaffected by aging or suffering. Here, they enjoyed the unlimited supply of food from a magic Cauldron and the ceaseless refreshing drink from an ever-flowing Well. Two kings, namely Arawn and Hafgan, ruled this land perpetually at war with each other, but it is Arawn who held a more significant position in legend.
