In a small English town called Abbots Bromley, there may be a remnant of worship for the horned god Cernunnos, stemming from the area's history with the Celtic tribe known as the Curnovii or "horned ones." Every year in early September, men adorned with antlers are "hunted" through the streets of the town, followed by a performance of the Horn Dance. This traditional dance is said to bring good luck but only when performed within the town limits. As Celtic beliefs have been known to persist through folklore, it is possible that this festival has ancient roots.
