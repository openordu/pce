A goddess named Adsagsona existed in the Continental Celtic tradition. People called upon Adsagsona to weave spells as she was considered a deity of magic and of the Otherworld. Moreover, she was known as "she who seeks out" as she possessed the ability to locate the target of any curse or blessing.
