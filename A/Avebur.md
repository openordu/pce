A mysterious site in Britain known as Avebury is steeped in mythological significance. The site's great Stone Circles have been associated with the Druids for hundreds of years, even though they were built thousands of years before the Celts arrived in Britain. Upon their arrival in north Wiltshire, the Celts discovered a vast ditch-encircled site with four openings, each corresponding to a cardinal direction, that contained great stones standing upright inside the ring. Additionally, a double parade of stones stood like sentinels along a pathway that led to a nearby hill. While there is evidence that the Celts may have repurposed the location to fit their own rituals, similar to StoneHENGE, Avebury was not constructed by the Celts, but rather by the mystical Megalithic Civilization that existed before the Celts. The site is so extensive that an entire village has taken shape within its borders.
