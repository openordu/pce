A heroic figure known as Agretes once ruled over Camelot before King Arthur ascended to the throne. Agretes' life came to a tragic end due to his refusal to aid a pilgrim from the Holy Land who possessed the revered Grail. His refusal resulted in him being struck with madness, leading to his ultimate demise.
