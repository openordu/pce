An Ulster princess named Achall is renowned as an Irish heroine. Situated just east of Tara, the historical locus of Ireland's royal power, stands a hill named after this woman who perished of heartbreak when Conall Cernach took the life of her brother, Erc. She was regarded as one of the six most notable women of Ireland, thanks to her selfless devotion to her sibling.
