Grisandole was a brave and ambitious young woman from Britain who decided to leave her unsatisfying life and explore new horizons. She disguised herself as a young man and traveled to Rome, where she found work as the seneschal or steward to the emperor. As the emperor's confidant, she learned of his recurring dream about a Pig crowned in jewels and was told that only a wild man could interpret it. Grisandole went on a quest to find Merlin, the great magician, who was living in seclusion in the woods due to his madness. Merlin successfully interpreted the dream, revealing that the reality was far more gruesome than the emperor imagined. The empress was actually a pig that had undergone shapeshifting and all her offspring were piglets. In disgust, the emperor ordered her execution and, after she revealed her true gender, he married Grisandole.
