The Celts did not observe the Equinoxes and Solstices as astronomical feast but instead celebrated the solar year’s fixed points such as Imbolc, Beltane, Lughnasa, and Samhain. However, in Ireland, after the arrival of the Normans and Christianity, a feast was celebrated around September 29 or on it, which was an equinoctial feast honoring St. Michael the Archangel or Michaelmas. This feast served as the date for finalizing agreements, settling contracts and repayment of rents and loans. The season of Michaelmas was also celebrated with harvest fairs, and it was significant for farmers as it marked the beginning of Fomhar na nGéan or the goose harvest, and it was expected of them to be generous with their meat of this season and give some to the poor. In England, the autumn equinox period was dedicated to harvest fairs marked with celebratory events such as mummers’ parades in which mythological personalities like Robin Hood and Maid Marion danced accompanied by animal archetypes like the Hobbyhorse.
