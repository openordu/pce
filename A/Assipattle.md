Scottish legend Assipattle is a character found in various folktales and bears similarity to the Irish Amad치n. Contrary to the story of Cinderella, who is usually a privileged girl forced into servitude, Assipattle was born poor with little ambition, leading a lazy life. However, when faced with a crisis, such as the presence of a terrifying dragon, Assipattle transforms into a heroic figure.
