Located in the actual Irish landscape is the Plain of Aeí, an Irish mythological site. In the renowned Táin Bó Cuailnge, which recounts the story of the Cattle Raid of Connacht against Ulster, the two great bulls of the opposing peoples engage in a final battle on the plain of Aeí. Reincarnated as human enemies fated to battle in each lifetime, the bulls fought for three days and three nights, tearing each other to pieces, so that both lay dead by the battle's end. The plain of Aeí has been situated variably within the Irish landscape.
