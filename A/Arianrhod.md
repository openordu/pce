Arianrhod, also known as Arianrod or Aranrhod, is a Welsh heroine or goddess. In the fourth branch of the Welsh Mabinogion, her tale is told, and it is possible that she is a reduced version of an earlier goddess. The story begins with the rape of Goewin, who held a strange office for King Math. Goewin's life was dependent upon his feet resting in the lap of a virgin, Goewin sat endlessly on the floor beneath the king's throne serving as footholder. Gwydion and Gilfaethwy, Math’s nephews, are responsible for the violation. In compensation for this, Math married Goewin and cast a spell on the rapists. To preserve the king's life, Gwydion nominated his sister, Arianrhod, daughter of the mother goddess DÔN, to serve as the new footholder. Beautiful Arianrhod was asked if she was a virgin, and, as far as she knew, she said she was. Math asked her to step over his wand to demonstrate her purity, but when she did, she gave birth to two children she had conceived without her knowledge: Dylan and Lleu Llaw Gyffes. Immediately, Dylan, the first child, child of the sea, escaped into the watery realm. Arianrhod rejected the second child but claimed by Gwydion, whose son he may have been, and raised in a magical chest. When Lleu was grown, Arianrhod refused to give him either a name or weapons, both of which were prerogatives of a Welsh mother, and Gwydion tricked her again so that Lleu could attain his manhood. Confusion in the tale lies in its lack of clarity about whether Arianrhod's children were conceived at parthenogenesis, as would be appropriate for a goddess, or without her knowledge, as befits deceitful Gwydion. Arianrhod appears to be as surprised as anyone by the children issued from her womb, making it improbable that she was lying. “Silver wheel” is the meaning of her name, and Arianrhod has been interpreted by many as the remains or representation of a moon goddess from olden days. Conversely, she could be perceived as a mother deity of the land, as these types of goddesses were frequently referred to as virgin mothers. On the other hand, Arianrhod has been identified as a dawn goddess because she is the mother of both light (Lleu) and darkness (Dylan). According to Welsh lore, she lived among her maidens in her castle on the coastal island, Caer Arianrhod, which is also referred to as the Welsh name for the constellation, Corona Borealis. In that starry or seagirt realm, she lived recklessly, hinting at a resemblance to the Breton figure of Dahut. Due to the fact that the Welsh Triads name her as one of the “three fair maidens” or “white ladies” of the isle of Britain, she has also been compared to the ancestral deity Branwen.
