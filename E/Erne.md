Erne was a prominent figure in Irish mythology - a heroine or goddess. The Dindshenchas, a collection of Irish place-name poetry, recounts the tale of how the River Erne and the lake it flows from were named. Erne, an esteemed noblewoman known as the "chief among the maidens of Cruachan" (the capital of Connacht), journeyed to the region with a group of women. They had fled their homes after hearing a booming voice emanating from Oweynagat, or the Cave of the Cats. Erne carried with her a Comb, a symbol of feminine power, belonging to her mistress, the renowned queen Medb. While traveling northwards, the group perished in a lake, and the drowning of a woman in a significant water source typically signifies an ancient goddess of the watershed.
