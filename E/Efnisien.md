Efnisien, also known as Evnisien or Efnissien, was a Welsh hero or god and the malevolent brother of Brân The Blessed. The second branch of the Mabinogion, a collection of epic tales, revolves around Efnisien's role in causing the war between Wales and Ireland. Efnisien's usual mischief led him to mutilate the Irish Horses when his brother agreed to marry their sister Branwen at the proposal of the Irish king Matholwch. Horses, having both divine significance and usefulness in battle, were held in high regard by warriors, making this sacrilege a catalyst for war between former allies. Branwen was trapped in Ireland as a prisoner and endured humiliation at the hands of her husband. Upon learning this, Brân rallied his armies and marched into Ireland. However, Matholwch possessed a powerful weapon: the magical cauldron Brân had provided to him, which brought dead soldiers back to life as killing machines. To keep his army strong against Brân's troops, Matholwch used the cauldron. Efnisien redeemed himself by jumping into the cauldron, but being alive caused it to burst apart since it could only reinvigorate the dead.
