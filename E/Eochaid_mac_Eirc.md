A legendary ideal king of early times, Eochaid mac Eirc, was known to be married to the goddess Tailtiu who ensured the land was rich with bountiful harvests and rain so gentle it felt like dew. It was either Eochaid mac Eirc or his successor, Eochaid Gargh, who founded the Lughnasa fair in honor of Tailtiu at Teltown. Eochaid mac Eirc was a member of the Fir Bolg, an early race who opposed the arrival of the magical Tuatha Dé Danann but was defeated and killed in the first battle of Mag Tuired.
