A festival in Wales called the Eisteddfod has been celebrated for a long time and is widely considered as the longest running Celtic festival, even if some argue that Irelandâ€™s Puck Fair holds that title. It has always been a bardic competition, taking place each year in different locations in Wales around the time of the ancient Lughnasa feast, which is on August 1. According to many experts, the festival may have begun in Celtic times or shortly after that period, when Bards who had an extensive knowledge of oral traditions engaged in poetical duels. Despite the fact that it was recognized as a national event in 1860, it was already mentioned in historical records dating back to 1176. The festival showcases both poetry and song, which are performed in Welsh almost exclusively.
