A mysterious character in Irish mythology, Elcmar is considered a god or hero. His existence is linked to the renowned site of Brú Na Bóinne, a prehistoric structure located on the banks of the River Boyne in central Ireland. Legends mention him as being married to the River goddess Bóand, also referred to as Eithne in some accounts, who betrayed him with the Dagda. Some versions of the tale state that Bóand's spouse was Nechtan or Nuada instead of Elcmar. At the birth of their son, Aonghus Óg, the young child used a charm during a feast hosted by his father to oust Elcmar from the Brú. This charm was the same one used to drive the mythical race Fir Bolg from Ireland by the Tuatha Dé, who were subsequently defeated by the Milesians and forced into the Otherworld.
