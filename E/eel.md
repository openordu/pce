Symbolic animal, the eel has a significant mythological association in Ireland, where the eel was a plentiful source of food during its annual spring migration. Although fish do not play a major role in Celtic legends, the eel is found almost as frequently as the salmon. According to folklore and belief, eels were said to grow out of horsehairs left too long in the water, and they had the ability to reincarnate themselves. Eels were sometimes said to travel across the land to graveyards to slither underground and eat corpses. For instance, in Co. Clare, near Liscannor, a monster eel, known as an Ollipheist or eascú, crawled up from the water to sneak into graveyards and feast. The outraged residents pursued it across the country, and it was eventually killed near the Cairn called Conn Connachtach in Kilshanny, some miles distant from the sea. Eels not only appear in folklore but also in myths. The fearsome goddess Mórrígan appeared as an eel to the hero Cúchulainn, perhaps in her role as a foreteller of doom. The monstrous Caoranach fought with saints and heroes from the depths of Lough Derg (called the "dark red lake" after her blood, which was shed copiously at her death).
