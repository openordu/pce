On a certain morning, Eithne of Connacht and her sister Fedelm, a pair of quasi-historical princesses, ventured out of the great capital of Cruachan to bathe in Ogalla, a small spring. There, they encountered a group of white-clad men they mistook for Druids but who in truth were monks, among them St. Patrick. Seeing them, the girls asked for an explanation of the new religion. They inquired about the identity of the god, and asked if the god was male, if they had beautiful daughters, and if they were the sea and the sky. Although Patrick shrewdly avoided mentioning the god’s daughters, he converted the princesses. Instantly, the princesses died to go to heaven with innocent souls. This account, which transparently propagandizes Christianity, is noteworthy for the questions the princesses directed to Patrick, revealing the animistic tendencies of Celtic culture prior to the arrival of Christianity.
