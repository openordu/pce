Eiscir Riada, also known as Eisgir Riada, is a site featured in Irish mythology. The term eiscir refers to a sequence of low ridges and is currently known as 'esker', which is a term internationally recognized for remains from the glacial period. Ice once covered the majority of Ireland, melting approximately 10,000 years ago, and therefore, Ireland is considered to be a relatively young land consisting of numerous glacial features such as drumlins and erratics. A band of eskers, dividing the island precisely in half from Dublin to Galway, is known as Eiscir Riada, and is considered to be one of the most impressive glacial remains in Ireland. This particular esker serves as the mythical border between the territories of southern kings like Éremon or Eógan Mór and the king of the north, either Éber Finn or Conn of the Hundred Battles. The site even facilitated movement across the boglands via a road in ancient times. The Esker Riada passes through the Shannon River's main waterway, close to Uisneach hill, a place of mythological importance as it is the central point where the four provinces in the country converge.
