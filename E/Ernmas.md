Irish goddess Ernmas, though not well-known, is recognized for giving birth to the three land goddesses, Fódla, Banba, and Ériu. Some ancient texts also refer to this goddess as Éirinn. Another association with Ernmas is as the mother of the three war goddesses Macha, Badb, and the Mórrígan. The modern Irish embas, meaning “death by iron” or “death by weapons,” is linked to Ernmas’ name.
