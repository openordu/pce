Irish legend or deity Éirinn (Eirinn) is mentioned in certain texts as the mother of the three goddesses of the Irish land: Ériu, Banba, and Fódla. Her name is thought to be derived from that of Ériu, who is the goddess of the island. This suggests that Éirinn is most likely a product of poetic tradition rather than an actual myth.
