A Continental Celtic god, Esus (Hesus), remains a mystery to us. Given the name “strength” or “rapid motion” or even “anger,” little is known about this Gaulish god. However, the Roman author Lucan provides us with provocative details of “uncouth Esus of the barbarous altars” who was worshiped with human sacrifice, where Druids would read the future from the streams of blood running down victims hung in trees. Other early authors link Esus to the Roman gods, Mercury and Mars, thus indicating he may have been a god of merchants and warriors. Altars and inscriptions show Esus in the company of Bulls and Cranes or working as a woodcutter. Additionally, there are names that seem to originate from him such as the Breton town of Essé, considered to be a centre of his worship, the people called the Esuvii in France, and personal names Esugenos meaning “son of Esus” and Esunertus meaning “strong as Esus.” Esus’ cult has been found in England, Switzerland, and France. With limited information available—some of which comes from the accounts of Celtic rivals, and thus may contain bias—scholars have attempted to reconstruct Esus’ character and worship. The fact that his victims were hung in trees and depictions of Esus cutting wood suggests he was a God of vegetation and his powers were believed to be present in the robust trees of the forest. The similarity between the name Esus and that of the Christian Jesus, along with the image of a victim hung on a tree, has led to imaginative interpretations in works such as the popular novel Daughter of the Shining Isles by Elizabeth Cunningham.
