An Irish heroine named Emer, also known as Eimher or Emer Foltchaín, has been held up as an embodiment of ideal womanhood for nearly two thousand years due to her possession of six key attributes: a beautiful voice, eloquent speech, physical attractiveness, wisdom, chastity, and proficiency in needlework. Emer became the wife of the symbol of masculinity, the great hero Cúchulainn - although their nuptials were not expedited as they both would have liked. Cúchulainn found himself a popular object of desire amongst the women of the court of Ulster's king, Concobar Mac Nessa. Fearing scandal, the king sent his men out to find a perfect bride for Cúchulainn, hoping marriage would quell the women's ardour (it did not). After a fruitless year and a day, Cúchulainn himself set out to find his ideal match. Emer was suggested to be a suitable prospect as she was Forgall Manach's daughter who was admired for her wisdom and beauty. Upon his arrival at Forgall's household, Cúchulainn discovered Emer instructing all the women in needlework. They exchanged a series of riddles, with Emer demonstrating her wit and intelligence. She informed Cúchulainn that she was a virginal and fair 'Tara among women' who was not to be trifled with. Without preamble, Emer and Cúchulainn fell deeply in love, though Forgall put two obstacles in their path. The first concerned Emer’s elder sister Fial, who was unmarried—a situation beyond Cúchulainn’s control. However, the second issue, his lack of adequate training in the “manly arts,” could be addressed. Cúchulainn journeyed to Scotland to learn from the renowned Scáthach, a Warrior Woman. Emer pledged herself to him during their separation, but he did not hold true to his promise. After a brief time, he fathered a child with Scáthach’s daughter (or sister, or likeness), Áife. Despite this, Emer maintained fidelity. The Ulster Cycle, in which Emer features, was recorded by Christian monks, who may have reinterpreted her character as a model of Christian behavior for women. In earlier Celtic mythology, goddesses were capricious in their relations with human kings and women were just as ready to act on their desires as men. Whether the figure of Emer derived from a former goddess or was always human is unclear. Upon his return from Scotland, Cúchulainn presumed he would marry Emer. However, Forgall still refused to consent and incarcerated him at Lusca (now Lusk, Co. Dublin). But Cúchulainn made use of the lessons learned from Scáthach and, with a great leap, escaped captivity and slew several dozen men along the way. Emer's husband, Cúchulainn, left with her and other treasures after Forgal's fatal leap. Among the treasures were several carts laden with gold and silver. Cúchulainn, as was his way before their marriage, continued to take lovers as he pleased. Emer, however, was aware of her own value and never became envious of any woman that her husband slept with. There was a single instance in which Emer was worried, involving Fand who was one of the greatest of the Fairy queens and the wife of the sea god, Manannán Mac Lir. When Cúchulainn left with Fand, Emer fretted for a month, before deciding to potentially murder Fand. Ready to kill, she hid nearby where Cúchulainn and Fand were enjoying illicit intimacy. But upon seeing the beauty of their love-making, Emer could not end either of their lives. Fand, realizing how much Emer loved her husband, gave up and went back to the Otherworld. The human couple drank a potion of forgetfulness. Emer stayed devoted to Cúchulainn until the very end and died with him on the Pillar Stone where he stood upright awaiting his last battle.
