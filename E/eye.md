A prominent symbol with deep and complicated meanings, the eye holds spiritual significance throughout the world as well as in Celtic history. Within the Celtic lands, there is evidence of an earlier cult for the Eye Goddess that likely dates back to the Neolithic or New Stone Age, with carvings of eye-like spirals found on rocks. This goddess may have influenced the concept of the Cailleach, who is often depicted with a single eye and considered a solar power. As a Sun goddess, the Cailleach represents the weaker winter sun, as she is associated with the violent storms of that season. In Scotland, she is also known as Bride, the summer maiden, but it is uncertain if this figure is connected to the Irish goddess Brigit, who is associated with spring's rejuvenation. Balor, the Fomorian king with an evil eye, is similarly linked to the winter season, as his single eye can blight vegetation. The connection between Brigit and the eye, as well as the sun, is strengthened by the dedication of many Irish holy wells to her. These wells are believed to have healing powers, especially for eye diseases. Traditionally, at these wells, one would rise at dawn, perform the well's prescribed ritual, and then bathe their eyes in the water. Many Irish people believe in the magical powers of sight, including Second Sight, which is the ability to see things before they happen or from a distance. Conversely, the evil eye refers to the idea that a spiteful person could curse another simply by looking at them. Ill intent could give the envious possession of an object by merely gazing at it. In Scotland and rural Ireland, squinting, observed in nearsighted people, was often considered as casting a curse. As a result of covetousness or envy, fear of the power of the evil eye existed. If others resentfully looked up to one's luck, they could destroy it. According to a Scottish proverb, "envy splits the rocks." A mere glance could lead to healthy animals' deaths, people being struck down by a mysterious ailment, and houses burning down. Protective measures against such ill fortune were popular, including verbal charms and protective gestures. Scottish people, to protect themselves from such misfortunes, had to take precautionary actions, such as not allowing animals with full bladders in the barn, putting sixpence in a bowl of water, and wearing red thread around their neck.
