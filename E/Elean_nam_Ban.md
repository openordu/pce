A site of Scottish folklore is Elean nam Ban, also known as Eilean nam Ban Móra. According to Highland folktales, there exists an "Isle of Women" somewhere off the coast. This island is identified by a green Well, marking the boundary of the world. In Celtic folklore, such enigmatic islands, unconstrained by time or location, serve as gateways to the Otherworld. At times, the island is known as Eilean nam Ban Móra, or the Island of the Big Women, implying that the occupants are Giants. On certain occasions, this name referred to a tangible landmass, the Isle of Eigg.
