Gracefully shaped and aesthetically pleasing, the elm tree was considered a symbol of importance and regarded as a sacred tree. The ancient Irish and British held the belief that it would bring misfortune to chop down these trees, demonstrating a reverence for their existence. Nowadays, even with the knowledge of their vulnerability to disease, cities still plant hundreds of elms. Evidence shows that the same type of blight that eradicated American elms also existed in Celtic lands during prehistory and history. This can be observed in the varying amounts of elm pollen found in the historic record. It's possible that the tradition of protecting elms from harm acknowledges the fragility of their genetics.
