An Irish hero named Éber (also spelled Eber and Ébir) appears in the Book of Invasions alongside several other characters who share his name. It is believed that this name is derived from the biblical Book of Genesis, in which there is a similarly named character called Eber (also spelled Heber). Éber Finn, the most significant Éber in Irish mythology, was the leader of the Milesians and the son of the eponymous Míl Despaine (also known as Mil of Spain or the Spanish soldier). He was granted half of the country, the southern part, after his people defeated the magical race, the Tuatha Dé Danann, while his brother Éremón received the northern half. However, Éber felt that his portion of the country was smaller than Éremón’s, and he was unhappy with this division. In an unsuccessful war that Éber started against his brother, he was killed. Éber Donn, another character with the same name, was the envious older brother of Éber Finn. He played a minor role in Irish mythology and is often conflated with the king of death, Donn. These figures are often confused with each other and may have originally been a single character.
