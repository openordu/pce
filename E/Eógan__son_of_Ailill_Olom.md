Eógan, the founder of Eóganacht (Owenacht) dynasty of southern Ireland, was the son of Ailill Olom and the grandson of Eógan Mór. One day, while resting with his foster brother, Lugaidh mac Conn, they heard enchanting music coming from a yew tree, which was the meaning of Eógan’s name, where a harper, Fer Í, which also means “yew,” played his harp. Eógan and Lugaidh attempted to speak to him but in vain. Despite the hypnotic harmony of the music, they became enemies, and Lugaidh’s manservant Do Dera took his place in the battle and was killed by Eógan. In a moment of confusion and shock, Eógan believed he had killed his brother but soon realized that Lugaidh had escaped. They encountered each other once again, this time with a Druid named Dil Maccu Crecga, who enchanted Eógan. The druid foresaw that Eógan would father a son with his daughter, Moncha, and their children would become the kings of Munster. After Eógan fathered a son with Moncha, he died in battle.
