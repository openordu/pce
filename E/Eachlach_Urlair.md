An important figure in Scottish folklore is Eachlach Urlair, also known as Eclock Urleer, Eachrais Ã¹rlair, Creeper on the Floor, or Trouble-the-House. This entity, believed to be a feminine spirit, is classified as a Bogie or Witch and was thought to reside near castles, providing an array of mysterious services to residents. Her name eventually came to represent any sort of domestic servant, although in Highland folklore, it is believed that she comes from the Otherworld, rather than the human world.
