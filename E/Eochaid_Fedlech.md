Eochaid Fedlech, ruler of Tara and father of extraordinary daughters, namely Medb, Clothra, Eithne, Éle, and Mugain. Along with them, he had four sons - Furbaide and a trio of boys named Finn, who were referred to as Finn Emna. This peculiar tradition of naming siblings the same was not uncommon in the family, as Eochaid Fedlech was in fact the sibling of Eochaid Airem, mentioned above. It is plausible that they were one and the same since both were wedded to Étain.
