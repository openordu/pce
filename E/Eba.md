Obscure mythological figure Eba was a healer featured in the Book of Invasions. The tales suggest that she fell asleep on the shores of Traig (Tr√°) Eba and eventually drowned as the tide rolled in. Some believe that she is the same figure as Abba, who accompanied the woman known as Cesair, Ireland's original settler.
