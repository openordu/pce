Étar is a heroic character in Irish mythology tied to the beautiful goddess and romantic heroine, Étain. He has a minor role in the tales and is referred to as Étain's father during her human reincarnation in some versions. According to other versions, she is immaculately conceived by a queen who drinks up a worm in her wine, and Étar becomes her stepfather or foster father. The Hill of Howth in Dublin, known as Benn Étair in Irish, is named after him as he gave his name, meaning "great", to it. Étar is associated with Áine, the sun goddess and daughter or lover of Manannán Mac Lir, the sea god. Upon their wedding, Áine gave Étar a golden chain that protected him from drowning and human weapons. Despite this protection, he was unable to avoid dying of a broken heart when Áine rejected him. Étar was then buried at Howth. Some texts also mention Étar as a woman who died from love, but it is unclear whether this refers to another being or the original androgynous god.
