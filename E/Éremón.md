An Irish hero named Éremón (also known as Heremon or Eremon) emerged as a leader of the Milesians. According to the Book of Invasions, the Milesians were the final group of invaders to arrive in Ireland. The mythical story tells how Éremón and his brother, Éber Finn, fought against the magical forces of the Tuatha Dé Danann for control of the island and won. The event is believed to be rooted in a historical memory of a final wave of Celts who came to Ireland and overtook the earlier Celtic and non-Celtic peoples who lived there. However, after the victory, the two brothers disagreed on who should rule the land. Wise poet Amairgin intervened and divided the territory in two, along the low glacial hills stretching from present-day Dublin to Galway, known as the Eiscir Riada. Éremón was given the north, while Éber Finn received the south. Despite this, Éber Finn remained dissatisfied and waged an unrelenting war against his brother until Éremón was eventually forced to kill him. Following this, Éremón became king of a united Ireland and established the kingship at Tara, which he named after his wife, Téa.
