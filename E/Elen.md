Elen, also known as Elen of the Hosts, Ellen, Helen, Ellyll, and Ellyllon, is a Welsh heroine or goddess. Many churches in Wales have been dedicated to St. Helen, who was the mother of the emperor Constantine. It is curious to wonder what a Roman matron was doing in Wales. However, according to folklore, St. Helen was actually Welsh herself and Coel Hen's daughter, who was referred to as "Old King Cole." The Welsh pseudo-saint was a Christianized version of the Welsh mythological figure Elen, who was assumed by many to be the wife of the famous magician Merlin. The Welsh dream of Maxen featured Elen, who was portrayed as the romantic interest of the conquering hero from the epic. The hero went on to become the emperor of Rome, then he returned to Wales to find the lovely maiden of his dreams. After marrying Elen, he reinforced the country with the assistance of her brothers and then returned to Rome to conquer it yet again. Furthermore, Elen of the Hosts, who might be the same person as Elen, was recognized as a builder of magical highways used to transport her armies across the country when required. She was bestowed with that name as a result of this. Elen's name is believed to have been derived from the Welsh word for elf or ghost, ellyll (pl., Ellyllon), which pertains to several Irish fairies with the name Aillén. The transparent small ellyll was frequently a solitary fairy, whereas the Ellyllon occasionally gathered beneath the authority of their queen, Mab, and danced around as trooping fairies. Ellylls often performed the duties of a Brownie by working around the house until found, at which point they disappeared instantly. They were, however, also highly magical creatures who lived in the wilderness and ate toadstools for dinner.
