An Irish goddess named Ébhlinne, also known as Evlinn, Ébliu, Éblenn, or Eblinne, was worshipped in Co. Tipperary, which lies close to the borders of Co. Limerick in Munster, Ireland’s southwest province. The range known as the Twelve Mountains of Ébhlinne, also referred to as the Keeper Hills, the Silvermine Mountains, and Slievefelim Mountains, was made in her honor. Mauher Slieve (Máthair-Shliabh) is the highest point in the range and is considered the mother mountain. Éblinne was praised during Midsummer celebrations, which continued until recent times, marking the Celtic harvest feast of Lughnasa. Similar to many ancient goddesses who were adapted into a new culture, Ébhlinne was transformed into a queen of the region. Ireland's geographical poetry, also known as the Dindshenchas, informs us that Guaire, the king of the Brú Na Bóinne pre-Celtic mound city on the River Boyne in eastern Ireland, was Ébhlinne's dad. She was married to the king of Cashel but eloped with her stepson. However, both the lovers drowned as they tried to escape through the waters of Lough Neagh. Ancient Celtic mythology frequently contains the theme of a woman leaving an older man for a younger one. This is exemplified in many love triangles, such as Guinevere, Lancelot, and Arthur in Britain, Tristan, Iseult, and Mark in Cornwall, and Gráinne, Diarmait, and Fionn Mac Cumhaill in Ireland. Such stories are typically associated with the goddess of Sovereignty, who kept the land fertile by marrying consecutive kings.
