Ésa, also spelled as Esa or Ess, was a heroine in Irish mythology who played a minor role. She was the daughter of Étain, a gorgeous fairy woman who became human, and Eochaid Airem, the human king of Tara. Étain was pregnant with Ésa when Midir, the fairy king and her first love, arrived from the Otherworld to take her back. Later, Eochaid ended up marrying his own daughter Ésa unknowingly as he was tricked into believing that she was Étain. The child of Eochaid and Ésa was the woman who became mad and eventually turned into a queen known as Mess Buachalla.
