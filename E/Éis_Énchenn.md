There was an Irish heroine named Éis Énchenn (also known as Ess Euchenn). When the great hero Cúchulainn went to Isle of Skye in Scotland to learn martial arts from a woman warrior named Scáthach, he had to contend with three strong men who were no match for him. Cúchulainn beheaded them and continued his journey. On his way back, he had to traverse a narrow road running alongside an abyss. While doing that, he came across a fragile hag who requested him to move over and let her pass. However, since there was space only for a single traveler on the road, Cúchulainn hung out over the abyss, keeping his balance only by his toes. Éis Énchenn, who was the mother of the warriors Bir, Blicne, and Ciri, the ones that Cúchulainn had killed, happened to be that crone. Instead of passing gracefully, she stomped on Cúchulainn's hands, hoping to send him tumbling to his demise. However, Cúchulainn executed his famous Salmon-leap and beheaded Éis Énchenn, killing her.
