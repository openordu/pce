Eithne of Tara, known as Eithne Tháebfhota, or Long-Sides, was the daughter of King Cathaír Mór. She was married to multiple kings of Tara, including Conn of the Hundred Battles and his grandson, Cormac Mac Airt, with whom she had a son named Cairbre Lifechair. During her reign at Tara, the fields yielded three crops annually, indicating that she was a manifestation of the Sovereignty goddess.
