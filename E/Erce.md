Obscurely known from early British verbal formulae called Charms is the British goddess Erce. She is referred to as the "mother of earth" and her name is believed to signify the "exalted one." It is challenging to differentiate whether she belonged to the Germanic or Celtic tribes since these historical communities cohabited and worshipped together.
