In Irish mythology, Easal, the King of the Golden Pillars, is remembered as a heroic figure. One of the Three Sorrows of Ireland, the tale of the Sons of Tuireann (written in 143 in the 6th century), narrates the story of how this king helped young warriors. The Sons of Tuireann needed to perform twelve extremely difficult tasks as punishment for killing their father’s enemies. Without Easal’s help, they would not have survived. Easal provided them with food obtained from magical pigs that miraculously restored themselves after being killed and consumed every evening. Eating this enchanted pork also granted immunity against any ailment. It’s possible that Easal embodied the image of the Dagda, the god of abundance who was likewise said to hold such self-restoring swine.
