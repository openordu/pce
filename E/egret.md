Waterbirds played a significant role as religious symbols for the Celts due to their ability to adapt to different environments such as air, water, and land. The egret, a bird known for its elegant feathers, served as a distinctive symbol for the continent's Celtic god, Esus. However, the Crane also held a place in Esus' iconography.
