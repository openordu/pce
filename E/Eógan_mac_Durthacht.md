Eógan mac Durthacht is a prominent character in Irish mythology, featuring in the Ulster Cycle's Three Sorrows Of Ireland. In the tragic tale of Deirdre of the Sorrows, Eógan is responsible for the death of the romantic hero Noísiu. King Concobar Mac Nessa gives Deirdre to Eógan in a fit of rage after realizing that she will never willingly belong to him. However, Deirdre would rather die than live without her lover and throws herself from Eógan's chariot. Eógan also appears in various supporting roles in other legends.
