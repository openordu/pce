A king named Cormac was married to Étain Óg, daughter of another Étain, and bore a daughter whom Étain Óg desired to have as her own. Because Cormac had a previous child, Étain Óg arranged for her husband's baby daughter to be killed. However, the warriors appointed for the task fell in love with the child and abandoned her in a cowshed with hopes that she would be saved. The cowherd who found her adopted her and she was then named Mess Buachalla. It should be noted that in some versions of the story, Mess Buachalla is the daughter of Ésa rather than Étain Óg.
