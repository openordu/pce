A tree of great symbolic significance is the elder tree (genus Sambucus) across most Celtic territories. The belief was that it was particularly unlucky to utilize the wood of an elder tree since the sprits of Fertility were believed to inhabit them. If there was a crisis and the only option was to use the wood of an elder tree, it was crucial to seek the tree and the spirits' consent. The branches might bleed at such a time, even with a sincere request. The tree's name alludes to its link to the Elf people, and in the northern part of Britain, it was called the eller tree. Until recently, individuals would often offer rags to the tree to attract good luck. In the Cotswolds, some superstitions associated elder trees with witches. People believed that an elder tree might be a transformed sorceress or could possess malicious energy. As a result, it was shunned as a construction material with cradles receiving particular attention. In Ireland and on the Isle of Man, elders were strongly connected with magical creatures including the Fairies and Giants. It's worth noting that, despite its frightening reputation, the elder tree was utilized to make berry wine and flower tea.
