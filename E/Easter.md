Easter is a festival that was not originally Celtic. Instead, in Celtic regions, the Christian observance of Easter took the place of Beltane, the spring festival which similarly marked resurrection and new life. In an Irish tale that is well known, the two festivals become confused, as St. Patrick is said to have kindled an "Easter fire" on the summit of Slane hill near Tara, in direct competition with the king's fire on the latter hill. Because pagan Ireland did not celebrate Easter, it can be assumed that these fires were lit for Beltane. Other traditions of Beltane and the spring season were adopted once Christianized, such as the notion that the sun danced on that day and that holy Wells had greater healing powers on that day.
