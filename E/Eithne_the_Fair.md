A woman named Eithne the Fair caught the attention of Finnbheara, the king of the Munster Fairies, due to her captivating charm. Finnbheara cast a spell over Eithne, causing her to fall into an unshakable sleep. In her slumber, Eithne travelled to the Otherworld, a land of great beauty. Upon awakening, she found the mortal world to be dreary and dismal. Eithne was guarded closely but managed to escape from her husband, making her way to the Fairy Mound at Knockma, which was located in the Fairies’ Glen in Co. Galway. Her husband pursued her and overheard the fairies talking about how pleased Finnbheara was with his beautiful new possession and that he would never be defeated until sunlight penetrated the heart of his mound. Her husband was devastated but determined to rescue her. He began to dig into the mound, but his search was fruitless until he heard whispered voices instructing him to sprinkle salt upon the ground. He did so and saw Eithne in the fairy court, where he rescued her. However, when she returned home, she remained in a comatose state and unable to communicate. Eventually, Eithne’s husband found a small fairy Pin holding a sash, and once he removed it, Eithne awoke. She thought she had been gone for only one night, but in fact, she had been asleep for a year.
