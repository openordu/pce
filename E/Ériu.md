The name of the green island situated at the extreme western edge of Europe is dedicated to the Irish goddess, Ériu. According to myth, when the final wave of conquerors, known as the Milesians, reached the island, they met three sisters who were goddesses of the land. Each goddess requested that the island be named after her. Banba, the sorceress, and Fódla, each made their demands from their preferred mountains, and in doing so, delayed the Milesians from arriving at the center of Ireland. However, the Milesians promised each goddess the same thing. It was only when they reached the center of Ireland that they found Ériu, who made the same demand. As Ériu pledged greater prosperity than the other two, Amairgin, the chief Bard of the Milesians, decided to name the island after her. Though Fódla and Banba are still used occasionally as poetic descriptions of Ireland. Ériu greeted the invaders from the sacred central mountain, Uisneach. Descriptions of her as adorned in rings, and her name originating from the word denoting "round," suggest that she was previously a solar or lunar goddess who presided over the sky. Owing to Ériu having power over the seas and the land, one of the invaders, Donn mac Míled, responded to her demands by insulting her, which led to his demise. A goddess of the magical Tuatha Dé Danann, Ériu was often depicted as an enormous female figure, but at times she appeared as a gray Crow with a long beak. She was also embodied by a sacred mountain that grew slowly over time as she aged. As the goddess of the center, Ériu was responsible for performing the Inauguration rite, known as banais ríghe. This ceremony bound the king's fate with that of the land, and he married her in the process. Ériu initiated the festival called Óenach every Beltane, celebrated annually on May 1 at Uisneach. The festival included various events like markets and games, as well as important sacred events like the lighting of Twin fires on the hilltop. Ériu's relationship to other gods and goddesses is described differently in various texts. She was said to be the daughter of the mother goddess Ernmas, the mother of the half-Fomorian king Bres mac Elatha, the wife of an obscure god named Mac Gréine (son of the sun), or Cethor, the lover of Elatha with whom she bore Bres, and the queen of Sovereignty who was also the mistress of the hero Lugh. Unfortunately, Ériu, like so many other Tuatha Dé Danann deities, was slain at the fierce battle of Táiltiu by the Milesians whom she had welcomed. The Stone Of Divisions marks her grave on Uisneach hill, which is considered to show a map of Ireland on its cracked surface.
