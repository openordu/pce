Enid, a heroine of Arthurian legends, represents the ideal of womanly virtue in several romances. She belongs to the group of Three Splendid Women of Camelot along with Dyfr and Tegau Eurfron. In order to prove himself worthy of marrying the beautiful Enid, the knight Erec embarks on a series of adventures, including hunting for a mysterious white Stag. Having showcased his strength and courage, Erec returns to the joys of Enid's company, which prove to be so delightful that he abandons his knightly duties. As time passes, courtly gossip about Erec's unworthiness to his wife reaches Enid's ears. Devastated by the rumors, Enid contrives for Erec to overhear them. Furious, Erec sets out to redeem his reputation, this time taking Enid along for company. Together they face various challenges, and ultimately they return to the court triumphant and renowned. In the Welsh version of the same tale, Enid's doting husband is Gereint. Although intermittently, references to Enid as a model of a perfect wife continue until the present day.
