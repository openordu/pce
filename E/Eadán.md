Eadán, an Irish hero, was among the Milesians - the final group of invaders who vanquished the magical Tuatha Dé Danann people, led by the goddess Danu, at the Tailtiu battle upon their arrival in Ireland. Fódla, one of the land’s three primary goddesses alongside Banba and Ériu, was among the Tuatha Dé that Eadán killed in combat. Even though not all of Fódla’s people perished, a number of them migrated to an Otherworld where they maintained their sway over the world they left behind.
