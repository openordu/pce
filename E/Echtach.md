Echtach, an Irish heroine or goddess, was often depicted as a spectral Owl who haunted east Co. Clare, the homeland of her sister Echthge, who was known for her cannibalism. It is uncertain whether Echtach is the same entity as Eachtach or not. There are some sources that consider Echtach to be a rival of Echthge rather than a sister. The relationship between the two figures remains unclear.
