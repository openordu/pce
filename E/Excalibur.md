Excalibur is a renowned Arthurian symbol and the most famous sword in European history. The sword belonged to King Arthur of Camelot, who received it from the magical Lady of the Lake. It is often mistaken for the unnamed sword that was extracted by the young Arthur from a rock, magically embedded by the great magician Merlin. Prophecy said that the one who would withdraw the sword from the rock would become the king of Britain, drawing many knights to make the attempt, but all failed until Arthur easily retrieved it. Arthur was given Excalibur after breaking that sword in combat, and it was created by the magical Smith Wayland. The sword had a unique property; its scabbard protected its possessor from all wounds. Arthur's sister Morgause, sometimes known as Morgan, stole the scabbard from Excalibur, with his son/nephew and enemy Mordred, leaving Arthur vulnerable. In his final battle, wounded Arthur threw the sword into a lake, where a mysterious hand emerged, presumably that of the Lady of the Lake. It is said that if Arthur reappears to lead his land again, the great sword will be ready for his hand. The name Excalibur is a modification of the Welsh Caladfwlch, which became Caliburn and finally Excalibur, due to a false connection with Latin. Caladbou, the sword wielded by the great Irish hero Fergus mac Róich, has also been associated with Excalibur.
