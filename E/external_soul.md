Symbolic objects known as external souls have been a belief in some cultures. It is thought that the soul can exist outside the body, such as in a stone or a tree. Celtic myths make reference to this belief, such as the story of Queen Créd who crushed her beloved Cano Mac Gartnáin's soul, or the tale of the hero Cúchulainn who caught a salmon hiding his rival Cú Roí's soul. Folklore also speaks of moths, butterflies, and sometimes bees that appear after someone's passing and hold their departing soul.
