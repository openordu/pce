Folkloric narratives often feature the motif of elf-locks. Fairies visiting humans during sleep would often plant dream sequences of blissful romantic encounters. However, those who were seduced in their dreams would awake to find their hair hopelessly tangled and impossible to comb out. Such playfulness was commonplace in interactions between fairies and humans, whether they occurred during waking life or dreams.
