A woman known as Étain, who lived in the Otherworld, was in a relationship with the Fairy king Midir. His Druid and sorceress wife, Fuamnach, became angry about this and transformed Étain into a fly. In this form, Étain had to fly around the world for many years until she landed in a cup of wine held by an Ulster princess. The princess drank the wine with the fly inside and became pregnant. (Drinking insects to become pregnant is a common element in Irish folklore.) The princess gave birth to a baby girl who she named Étain, who later became known as the most beautiful woman in Ireland. When Eochaid Airem wanted to become king at Tara, he had to find a queen to represent the goddess of the land. In his search for the perfect match, he discovered the beautiful Étain who had forgotten her past life and agreed to marry him. Their wedding and Eochaid's inauguration were celebrated extravagantly, suggesting a promising future. However, Midir had not forgotten Étain. He disguised himself as Ailill Anglonnach, Étain's husband's brother, and pretended to be sick, claiming that only Étain's touch could heal him. Étain reluctantly agreed to help him and the story describes Midir as sometimes taking on Ailill's identity to protect Étain's honor while still having access to her. Midir’s attempts to win Étain were not successful, until he concocted a plan. He went to Tara in his true form and challenged Eochaid to play Fidchell, a board game. Despite Eochaid’s confidence in his skills, he had never played against the forces of the Otherworld, nor against true love. Midir emerged victorious. After a second round in which Eochaid bet Étain as the prize, Midir won again, and by kissing her, Étain remembered their former life together. Together in love, they transformed into swans and flew out the skylight. As they fled to Connacht, Étain’s maid Crochan gave birth to Medb, who was Étain’s double. They eventually arrived at Midir’s home, the Fairy Mound, but Eochaid tried to take Étain back. Midir would not allow this and sent out 50 enchanted women resembling Étain, among whom was Eochaid's own daughter, Ésa. Eochaid only discovered this when he fathered a child with Ésa. Étain's romantic fortunes differ among its many variations. One version claims she broke through the fairy Glamour unaided and reunited with Eochaid. However, the majority of the story ends with Étain and her destined lover, Midir, living happily ever after.
